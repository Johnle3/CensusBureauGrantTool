Service, he realized, was the great equalizer. As he stated, &#8220;Everybody can be great, because everybody can serve.&#8221;&#8226; In recognition of that spirit, Congress in 1994 passed the King Holiday and Service Act. Since then CNCS, in partnership with the Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, Inc., has taken the lead in helping to transform the King Holiday into a day of service to meet community needs. As they have since 1994, thousands of Americans will remember Dr. King by serving in their communities, by making the holiday &#8220;A Day On, Not a Day Off.&#8221; Service projects will meet a tangible need in the community, such as supporting increased access to college, alleviating hunger, and teaching about nutrition, and these projects may, at the same time, also meet a need of community spirit, such as building a sense of community or mutual responsibility. All initiatives should serve as a call to service that continues throughout the year. These service projects will be built on Dr. King&#8217;s concepts of strengthening communities, empowering individuals, and bridging barriers.

9701,HUD,Department of Housing and Urban Development,HO,"On any given day, approximately 60,000 youth are confined in juvenile detention and correctional facilities and hundreds of thousands more are on probation. This system contact can have a significant impact on adolescents lives and their prospects for long-term success in adulthood in obtaining academic degrees, finding work, and securing housing. Collateral consequences (including the lack of records expungement) for juveniles who have come into contact with the juvenile justice system can hinder the ability of young people to integrate into their communities and become successful, thriving adults and increase their chances of recidivism. Barriers to housing, education, employment, health care, and insurance as well as serious immigration consequences and financial repercussions are chief among the tangible consequences. Social, emotional and psychological consequences such as trauma, and a sense of shame and humiliation, are also of great concern.

Examples of support services include employment counseling, occupational training, transportation, counseling, child care services, safety planning, case management, and other assistance. Support services must be offered to survivors on a voluntary basis. Voluntary support services are designed with survivor-input to meet the individual needs of each survivor. When implementing a voluntary services model through a trauma-informed approach, effective transitional housing supports the self-determination of survivors and adapts services to their individual needs. Staff who have been trained in working with victims of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, or stalking may also be funded to support transitional housing participants. "
19384,USDOJ-OJP-OVW,Office on Violence Against Women,HO,"Victims of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking in rural communities face unique challenges and barriers to receiving assistance rarely encountered in urban areas.

The FSS program promotes the development of local strategies to coordinate the use of assistance under the HCV and PH programs with public and private resources to enable participating families to increase earned income and financial literacy, reduce or eliminate the need for welfare assistance, and make progress toward economic independence and self-sufficiency. PHAs or tribes/Tribally Designated Housing Entities (TDHEs) that administer FSS programs enter into five-year contracts with new families on an ongoing basis. The FSS contract spells out the terms and conditions governing participation and the responsibilities of both the PHA (or tribe/TDHE) and the family. PHAs are not permitted to limit FSS participation to those families most likely to succeed because of current education level or job history. "

25359,HUD,Department of Housing and Urban Development,HO," 1. Purpose. The purpose of the Jobs Plus Pilot program is to develop locally-based, job-driven approaches to increase earnings and advance employment outcomes through work readiness, employer linkages, job placement, educational advancement, technology skills, and financial literacy for residents of public housing. The place-based Jobs Plus Pilot program addresses poverty among public housing residents by incentivizing and enabling employment through earned income disregards for working families, and a set of services designed to support work including employer linkages, job placement and counseling, educational advancement, and financial counseling. Ideally, these incentives will saturate the target developments, building a culture of work and making working families the norm. The Jobs Plus Pilot program consists of the following three core components: Employment-Related Services Financial Incentives &#8211; Jobs Plus Earned Income Disregard (JPEID) Community Supports for Work Applicants are encouraged to develop key partnerships to connect participants with any other needed services to remove barriers to work. An Individualized Training and Services Plan (ITSP) should be developed for each participant to establish goals and service strategies, and to track progress. Background HUD, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the MDRC, through a public-private partnership, designed and supported the Jobs Plus program model between 1998 and 2003. HUD has issued two separate evaluation reports on the demonstration, in an effort to identify and document the most promising approaches to increasing employment among families in public housing. Each evaluation showed ongoing positive effects for residents when the program was well-implemented and included the three core elements. More information on the findings can be found at http://www.mdrc.org/project/jobs-plus-community-revitalization-initiative-public-housing-families#overview. Employment-Related Services Successful applicants must partner with the Department of Labor Workforce Investment Board (WIB) and American Job Center (AJC)/One-Stop in their area to offer multiple employment-related services for residents with a range of employment needs. Local Labor Market Information (LMI) should be used both for initial planning and analysis of which employment opportunities are most available locally, as well as for monitoring ongoing trends. Program services provided on-site should include, but need not be limited to, the following: Career exploration/job readiness workshops Job search and job placement assistance Work experience including on-the-job training, internships, pre-apprenticeships and Registered Apprenticeships (HUD encourages opportunities for residents to be paid while training whenever possible) Facilitated connections to education and training opportunities Rapid re-employment assistance in the event of job loss Proactive post-placement job retention support and career advancement coaching Access to computers, phones, fax, and copy machines and other supplies, for participants&#8217; employment-related uses as well as adequate training on how to use these technologies To facilitate these employment services, applicants may consider having dedicated, on-site, workforce system staff to perform job developer and case manager functions. Job developers work directly with the business community to identify and create employment opportunities and act as liaisons with local employment agencies. Case managers work one-on-one with participants to guide them through the employment process and help them achieve employment-related goals. Financial Incentives &#8211; Jobs Plus Earned Income Disregard (JPEID) Successful applicants must also implement a financial incentive to program participants, known as the Jobs Plus Earned Income Disregard (JPEID). This component will neutralize any rent increase due to rising income for Jobs Plus participants, removing a major disincentive to employment. Rent incentives offered through JPEID will be reimbursed to the PHA via Jobs Plus appropriations, and should be included in the program budget. Any other compensation to the PHA for lost rent revenues, such as by the standard EID calculation in the Operating Fund, will be offset manually to prevent overpayment of HUD funds to grant recipients. Further guidance will be available at the time of the award. All residents in a Jobs Plus development are eligible to receive the JPEID benefit, but in order to access JPEID they must sign up for the Jobs Plus program even if they do not actively participate in other Jobs Plus Activities. Residents who previously used up some or all of their lifetime EID eligibility are eligible to receive the full JPEID benefit. Disregarded Amount. The JPEID excludes from the Family Rent calculation 100 percent of incremental earned income for the entire period of the Jobs Plus program. Calculation of the JPEID. Once the JPEID is triggered for a family, their baseline income will not change for the duration of the term of the grant (so participants who enroll early may benefit from the JPEID longer than residents who enroll later.) To facilitate reimbursements for rent revenue losses due to the JPEID, grantees must calculate and document each participant&#8217;s Family Rent both before and after the inclusion of any incremental earned income. The difference between these two rents is the amount to be reimbursed to the PHA through JPEID. These calculations must be provided to HUD when drawing reimbursement funds. As with any government benefit, an increase in earned income may result in the reduction or loss of other benefits that an individual was previously receiving. Grantees, through case management or other means, must be prepared to help residents understand the overall financial impact of an increase in earned income and the JPEID. It is also expected that grantees will encourage participants to take advantage of other financial work incentives they may be entitled to, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). Community Supports for Work Successful applicants will incorporate a robust engagement strategy for involving the residents in the targeted development and creating a working community. Engagement is more than signing up &#8211; sustained involvement in the program leading to residents&apos; ownership of their own growth and experiences, as well as that of peers, will yield continued benefits for both participants and future residents of the development beyond the grant period. Program outreach should be directed towards residents at all points along the employment spectrum &#8211; from unemployed individuals with no work history to working underemployed families with substantial work history. Unless an application specifies that the applicant will target a limited sub-group, the application narrative should include strategies to target this wide range of potential participants, as well as strategies for retention. One key strategy for retention should include the use of residents as Community Coaches. Community Coaches can market the various aspects of the Jobs Plus program, disseminate information about job opportunities and programs via resident social networks in the development, mentor specific individuals or groups who enroll in Jobs Plus, and help shape program offerings and outreach efforts based on their intimate knowledge of the needs and strengths of the community. Partnerships with Local Agencies The comprehensive nature of the Jobs Plus Pilot model requires that PHAs establish partnerships with American Job Centers and other key social service agencies within the community. HUD and DOL have developed a toolkit and webinar which describes effective strategies for establishing partnerships between PHAs and WIBs/AJCs (see &#8220;From the Ground Up: Creating Partnerships between Public Housing Authorities and Workforce Investment Boards&#8221; at (http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/documents/huddoc?id=14_dol_publication.pdf) The toolkit provides several models for partnership that prospective applicants may want to consider. These partnerships will serve to strengthen program planning and implementation, as well as streamline access to services for participants. For each partner identified, applicants must describe the role of the partner agency and a description of the services to be provided by the partner agency, as well as the amount of grant funding (if any) that partners will receive. Applicants should demonstrate their ability to build collaboration among all partners, regardless of whether a partner will be receiving grant funding for their services, or if the services will be provided in-kind. Partners should include: Workforce Investment Boards/American Job Centers Local welfare agencies Employment and training organizations Vocational training providers Community colleges and four-year educational institutions Other supportive service agencies providing either direct services or referrals to services that are critical for supporting successful employment In addition to employment, training and educational supports, grantees will have the flexibility to provide other supportive services based on resident needs and local capacity. HUD expects that all services that are generally available to residents of the community will be leveraged in-kind from partners. Grant funds should only be used to procure services that are not already available (either by service type or amount). Examples of the types of services that may be provided by grant funds, formal partners or the program&#8217;s referral network include but are not limited to the following: Child care services and/or after school programs Transportation assistance Financial literacy workshops Legal services (e.g. expungement) Domestic violence prevention services Services for formerly incarcerated/returning citizens Life Skills Other applicable local business support "

27347,USDOJ-OJP-OVW,Office on Violence Against Women,HO,"Victims of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking in rural communities face unique challenges and barriers to receiving assistance rarely encountered in urban areas. The geographic isolation, transportation barriers, economic structure, particularly strong social and cultural pressures, and lack of available services in rural jurisdictions significantly compound the problems confronted by those seeking support and services to end the violence in their lives. These factors also complicate the ability of the criminal justice system to investigate and prosecute sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking cases. In addition, socio-cultural, economic, and geographic barriers create difficulties for victim services providers to identify and assist victims of these crimes.The United States Department of Justice, Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) (www.ovw.usdoj.gov) is pleased to announce that it is seeking applications for the Fiscal Year 2018 Rural Sexual Assault, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, and Stalking Assistance Program.

OVW is interested in programs with a holistic, victim-centered approach to providing transitional housing services that move survivors into permanent housing. Transitional housing can be provided in facilities that are owned by the applicant, in units that are leased by the applicant, or by providing rental assistance for units leased directly to victims. Support services offered should help transitional housing participants locate and secure permanent housing, secure employment, and integrate into a community. Examples of support services include employment counseling, occupational training, transportation, counseling, child care services, safety planning, case management, and other assistance. Support services must be offered to survivors on a voluntary basis. Voluntary support services are designed with survivor-input to meet the individual needs of each survivor. When implementing a voluntary services model through a trauma-informed approach, effective transitional housing supports the self-determination of survivors and adapts services to their individual needs. Staff who have been trained in working with victims of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, or stalking may also be funded to support transitional housing participants."

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This Notice announces the availability of capital funds for assistance under VA&#146;s Homeless Providers Grant and Per Diem Program for eligible entities to: 1) expand existing transitional housing projects; or 2) develop new transitional housing programs. Supportive service centers will not be considered in this Notice of Fund Availability (NOFA). Funding applied for under the capital grant component may be used for: (1) remodeling or alteration of existing buildings; (2) acquisition of buildings, acquisition and rehabilitation of buildings; (3) new construction; and (4) acquisition of vans (in connection with a new or existing Grant and Per Diem Grant project) for outreach to and transportation for homeless veterans. Funding applied for under this Notice is authorized by Public Law 109-461, &#167; 703, the Veterans Benefit, Health Care and Information Technology Act of 2006, and by 38 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2011, 2012, 2061, 2064, and may be used as aid for supportive housing. Eligibility criteria may be found in the Final Rule published in the Federal Register on September 26, 2003. Capital grant applicants may not receive assistance to replace funds provided by any State or local government to assist homeless persons. Note: Applicants considering the use of Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC) in conjunction with the capital grants in this NOFA should take into account that these tax credits are generally for permanent housing projects. Permanent housing is not an eligible activity under VA&#146;s Homeless Providers Grant and Per Diem Program. Other issues such as a reduction in the base of the tax credits, site control, leases for residents, and using the tax credits as a loan may be problematic to applicants even if transitional housing is provided and upon review and discovery may result in the application being denied. A proposal for an existing project that seeks to shift its focus by changing the population being served or the precise mix of services being offered is not eligible for consideration. No more than 25 percent of housing and services available in projects funded through this grant program may be provided to clients who are not receiving those services as veterans. VA is pleased to issue this NOFA for the Homeless Providers Grant and Per Diem Program. The Department expects to award approximately $25 million under the capital grant component. Funding available under this NOFA is being offered to help offset the capital expenses of existing state and local governments, Indian Tribal Governments, faith-based, and community-based organizations that are capable of creating and providing supported transitional housing for homeless veterans. The District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, any territory or possession of the United States, are considered eligible entities under the definition of &#147;State&#148; in the Final Rule, Sec. 61.1 Definitions. Per diem for these programs is requested in the grant application and may be paid at the time of grant project completion. It should be noted that VA per diem payment is limited to the applicant&#146;s cost of care per eligible veteran minus other sources of payments to the applicant for furnishing services to homeless veterans up to the per day rate VA pays for State Home Domiciliary care. Awardees will be required to support their request for per diem payment with adequate fiscal documentation as to program income and expenses. Interested organizations should know that the vast majority of homeless veterans in this country suffer from mental illness or substance abuse disorders or are dually diagnosed with both mental illness and substance abuse disorders. In addition, many homeless veterans have serious medical problems. The recent events associated with the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) coupled with the Nation&#146;s returning OEF/OIF veterans further emphasizes the need for collaboration with VA medical centers, VA community-based outpatient clinics or other health care providers as well as with VA and other benefit providers as an important aspect of ensuring that homeless veterans have access to appropriate health care services. VA considers this program an important part of our effort to end chronic homelessness among all veterans. It is important to be aware that VA places great emphasis on responsibility and accountability. VA has procedures in place to verify the completion of the capital grant as well as monitor services provided to homeless veterans and outcomes associated with the services provided in grant and per diem-funded programs. Applicants should be aware of the following: All awardees that are conditionally selected in response to this NOFA must meet the Life Safety Code of the National Fire Protection Association as it relates to their specific facility. Applicants should note that all facilities are to be sprinkled unless they are specifically exempted under the Life Safety Code and make consideration of this when submitting their capital grant applications. VA will conduct an inspection prior to awardees being able to submit request for per diem payment to ensure this requirement is met. Upon capital grant completion, each program seeking per diem will have a liaison appointed from a nearby VA medical facility to provide oversight and monitor services provided to homeless veterans in the per diem-funded program. Monitoring will include at a minimum an annual review of each per diem program&apos;s progress toward meeting internal goals and objectives in helping veterans attain housing stability, adequate income support, and self sufficiency as identified in each per diem program&apos;s original application. Monitoring will also include a review of the agency&#146;s income and expenses as they relate to this project to ensure per diem payment is accurate. Each per diem-funded program will participate in VA&apos;s national program monitoring and evaluation system administered by VA&apos;s Northeast Program Evaluation Center (NEPEC). NEPEC&apos;s monitoring procedures will be used to determine successful accomplishment of these housing outcomes for each per diem-funded program. AUTHORITY: Funding applied for under this Notice is authorized by Public Law 109-461, &#167; 703, the Veterans Benefit, Health Care and Information Technology Act of 2006, and by 38 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2011, 2012, 2061, 2064, and may be used as aid for supportive housing. The program is implemented by the final rule codified at 38 CFR Part 61.0. The final rule was published in the Federal Register on September 26, 2003, the regulations can be found in their entirety in 38 CFR, Sec. 61.0 through 61.82. Funds made available under this Notice are subject to the requirements of those regulations. ALLOCATION: Approximately $25 million is available for the capital grant component. Capital grant awards will be limited to transitional housing projects, (service center programs will not be considered in this round). Vans must be directly connected to a new or existing Grant and Per Diem Grant project and will be limited to one per project number. Per diem payments to capital grant recipients are subject to the availability of funds and recipients maintaining the program for which the grant was awarded.

The highest-ranked application for which funding is available, within the highest funding category, will be conditionally selected in accordance with their ranked order until VA reaches the projected amount of funding for each category. If funds are still available after selection of those applications in the highest priority group VA will continue to conditionally select applicants in lower priority categories in accordance with the selection method set forth in the final rule Sec. 61.14. APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS: Applicants must include a cover letter clearly stating under which funding priority they wish to be considered.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This Notice announces the availability of funds for assistance under VA&apos;s Homeless Providers Grant and Per Diem Program for eligible programs that have not previously applied for or received per diem in connection with a grant (see 38 CFR 61.1 through 61.82). Funding applied for under this Notice is authorized by Public Law 109-461, &#167; 703, known as the Veterans Benefit, Health Care and Information Technology Act of 2006, and by 38 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2011, 2012, 2061, 2064, and may be used for aid for supportive housing. Service Centers will not be funded in this NOFA. Funding will be in the form of per diem payments issued to eligible entities from the date of award and will continue subject to availability of funds and the recipients&#146; compliance with 38 CFR 61.1 through 61.82. For eligibility criteria please refer to Final Rule published in the Federal Register on September 26, 2003, 38 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 61.30, 61.31, and 61.32. VA expects that it will take no longer than 90 days from the date of award for projects to be inspected and become operational. Failure to meet the 90 day milestone may result in the per diem award being terminated. Capital grant recipients who received capital grant funding under VA&#146;s Homeless Providers Grant and Per Diem Program in years 1994 through 2007 for acquisition, renovation or new construction should not respond to this NOFA. Per diem payments for those portions of their programs that were created with capital grant funds is requested in the capital grant application and paid at the time of capital grant project completion and inspection. Previous &#147;Per Diem Only&#148; recipients that renewed their PDO grants in 2005 or 2007 need not reapply to continue these projects. VA is pleased to issue this Notice of Fund Availability (NOFA) for the Homeless Providers Grant and Per Diem Program as a part of the effort to end chronic homelessness among our Nation&#146;s veterans. The Department expects to create approximately 1000 beds under this NOFA. Funding available under this NOFA is being offered to help offset the operating expenses of existing state and local governments, Indian Tribal Governments, faith-based, and community-based organizations that are capable of providing supported housing and supportive services for homeless veterans. The District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, any territory or possession of the United States, may be considered eligible entities under the definition of &#147;State&#148; in the 38 CFR 61.1 Definitions. It should be noted that VA payment is limited to the applicant&#146;s cost of care per eligible veteran minus other sources of payments to the applicant for furnishing services to homeless veterans up to the per day rate VA pays for State Home Domiciliary care. Awardees will be required to support their request for per diem payment with adequate fiscal documentation as to program income and expenses. Interested organizations should know that the vast majority of homeless veterans in this country suffer from mental illness or substance abuse disorders or are dually diagnosed with both mental illness and substance abuse disorders. In addition, many homeless veterans have serious medical problems. The recent events associated with the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) coupled with the Nation&#146;s returning OIF/OEF veterans further emphasizes the need for collaboration with VA medical centers, VA community-based outpatient clinics or other health care providers as well as with VA and other benefit providers as an important aspect of ensuring that homeless veterans have access to appropriate health care services. VA considers this program an important part of our effort to end chronic homelessness among all veterans. It is important to be aware that VA places great emphasis on responsibility and accountability. VA has procedures in place to monitor services provided to homeless veterans and outcomes associated with the services provided in grant and per diem-funded programs. VA is also implementing new procedures to further this effort. Applicants should be aware of the following: All awardees that are conditionally selected in response to this NOFA must meet the Life Safety Code of the National Fire and Protection Association as it relates to their specific facility. Applicants should note that all facilities are to be sprinkled unless they are specifically exempted under the Life Safety Code and make consideration of this when submitting their grant applications as no additional funds will be made available for capital improvements under this per diem only NOFA. VA will conduct an inspection prior to awardees being able to submit request for payment to ensure this requirement is met. Each per diem-funded program will have a liaison appointed from a nearby VA medical facility to provide oversight and monitor services provided to homeless veterans in the per diem-funded program. Monitoring will include at least an annual review of each per diem program&apos;s progress toward meeting internal goals and objectives in helping veterans attain housing stability, adequate income support, and self sufficiency as identified in each per diem program&apos;s original application. Monitoring will also include a review of the agency&#146;s income and expenses as they relate to this project to ensure per diem payment is accurate. Each per diem-funded program will participate in VA&apos;s national program monitoring and evaluation system administered by VA&apos;s Northeast Program Evaluation Center (NEPEC). It is the intention of VA to develop specific performance targets with respect to housing for homeless veterans. NEPEC&apos;s monitoring procedures will be used to determine successful accomplishment of these housing outcomes for each per diem-funded program. VA encourages all eligible and interested entities to review this NOFA and consider applying for funds to provide service for homeless veterans. AUTHORITY: VA&#146;s Homeless Providers Grant and Per Diem Program is authorized by Public Law 109-461, &#167; 703, known as the Veterans Benefit, Health Care and Information Technology Act of 2006, and by 38 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2011, 2012, 2061, 2064. The program is implemented by the final rule codified at 38 CFR Part 61.0. The final rule was published in the Federal Register on September 26, 2003, the regulations can be found in their entirety in 38 CFR, Sec. 61.0 through 61.82. Funds made available under this Notice are subject to the requirements of those regulations. ALLOCATION: Approximately $12 million annually is available for the per diem only award component of this program. This funding subject to the availability of funds and will be available so long as recipients meet the requirements of 38 CFR 61.1 through 61.82.

In this round of capital grant funding, VA expects to award funding to create approximately 1000 community-based supported housing beds. Funding priority 1. VA is offering the opportunity for providers who are willing to create new projects specifically for women and women with care of dependent children only, which are 30 beds or less. Of those eligible entities in the first funding priority, that are legally fundable, the highest scoring applicants will be funded first until approximately 150 beds are awarded.

Applicants will then be notified of the deadline to submit such information. If an applicant is unable to meet any conditions for grant award within the specified time frame, VA reserves the right to not award funds and to use the funds available for other grant and per diem applicants."
30157,HUD,Department of Housing and Urban Development,HO,"With this publication, HUD is making available up to $5,000,000 for Planning Grants, including Planning and Action Grants.1. Planning Grants are two-year grants that assist communities with severely distressed public or HUD-assisted housing in developing a successful neighborhood transformation plan and building the support necessary for that plan to be successfully implemented.2. Planning and Action Grants are three and a half year planning grants that pair planning with action. Experience shows that tangible actions taken early on help communities build momentum for further planning and the eventual transition from planning to implementation of that plan. These actions improve neighborhood confidence, which in turn sustains the community&#8217;s energy, attracts more engagement and resources, and helps convince skeptical stakeholders that positive change is possible. Under these grants, the planning process activities would take place during the first 24 months of the grant period. The planning process will identify Action Activities that will be carried out during the latter portion of the grant period. Action Activities must build upon the planning for the target housing and neighborhood."

Through annual NOFAs, HUD has provided funding to public housing agencies (PHAs) that are operating HCV FSS programs to enable those PHAs to employ program coordinators to support their HCV FSS programs. In the Fiscal Year (FY) 2008 HCV FSS Program Coordinator NOFA, HUD is again making funding available to PHAs to employ HCV FSS program coordinators and HCV FSS homeownership program coordinators for one year. Funding priority under this NOFA will be provided to applicants with Public Housing Information Center (PIC) data confirming that their FSS families have purchased homes and to applicants whose PIC data demonstrate program accomplishments, such as increased HCV FSS program size, increased earned income of program participants, and families successfully completing their FSS contracts. HUD will accept applications from both new and renewal PHAs that have HUD approval to administer an HCV FSS program. PHAs funded under the HCV FSS NOFA in FY 2005, FY 2006, or FY 2007 are considered &#147;renewal&#148; PHAs in this NOFA.

30749,HUD,Department of Housing and Urban Development,HO,"Purpose of Program. The purpose of the Public Housing FSS (PH FSS) program is to promote the development of local strategies to coordinate the use of assistance under the Public Housing program with public and private resources, enable participating families to increase earned income, reduce or eliminate the need for welfare assistance, and make progress toward achieving economic independence and housing self-sufficiency. The FSS program and this FSS NOFA support the Department&#146;s strategic goals of helping HUD-assisted renters make progress toward housing self-sufficiency. The FSS program provides critical tools that can be used by communities to support welfare reform and help families develop new skills that will lead to economic self-sufficiency. As a result of their participation in the FSS program, many families have achieved stable, well-paid employment, which has made it possible for them to become homeowners or move to other non-assisted housing. An FSS program coordinator assures that program participants are linked to the supportive services they need to achieve self-sufficiency.2. Funding Available. HUD expects to award a total of approximately $12 million in FY 2008. "
30751,HUD,Department of Housing and Urban Development,HO,"The purpose of the Public and Indian Housing Resident Opportunity and Self Sufficiency (ROSS) program is to provide grants to public housing agencies (PHAs), tribes/tribally designated housing entities (TDHEs), Resident Associations (RAs), and nonprofit organizations (including grassroots, faith-based and other community-based organizations) for the provision of a Service Coordinator to coordinate supportive services and other activities designed to help Public and Indian housing residents attain economic and housing self-sufficiency. This program works to promote the development of local strategies to coordinate the use of assistance under the Public Housing program with public and private resources, for supportive services and resident empowerment activities. These services should enable participating families to increase earned income, reduce or eliminate the need for welfare assistance, make progress toward achieving economic independence and housing self-sufficiency, or, in the case of elderly or disabled residents, help improve living conditions and enable residents to age-in-place. A Service Coordinator ensures that program participants are linked to the supportive services they need to achieve self-sufficiency or remain independent. Funds in this program will no longer be allowed to be used for the direct provision of these services. This program is similar to the Public Housing FSS program (PH FSS), however, the PH FSS program is open only to PHAs and Tribes/TDHEs, has a requirement of an escrow account for its participants and is one-year funding. The ROSS SC program is open to non-profit and Resident Association applicants, is three-year funding, includes admin expenses and training as eligible uses of the funds and requires a 25% match by statute. A PHA or Tribe may receive grants in both programs. "

This program will assist American Indian and Alaska Native tribal governments to develop comprehensive programs to identify and remediate housing issues that contribute to health and safety issues in urban and tribal communities.The Healthy Homes Production (HHP) Program is part of HUD&#8217;s overall Healthy Homes Initiative launched in 1999. The program takes a comprehensive approach to addressing multiple childhood diseases and injuries in the home by focusing on housing-related hazards in a coordinated fashion, rather than addressing a single hazard at a time. The program builds upon HUD&#8217;s experience with Lead Hazard Control programs to expand the Department&#8217;s efforts to address a variety of high-priority environmental health and safety hazards. Applicants receiving an award will be expected to accomplish the following objectives: 1. Maximize both the number of vulnerable residents (children, elderly) protected from housing-related environmental health and safety hazards and the number of housing units where these hazards are controlled; 2. Identify and remediate priority housing-related health and safety hazards in privately owned, low-income rental and/or owner occupied housing, especially in units and/or buildings where children and elderly reside; 3. Promote cost-effective and efficient healthy home methods and approaches that can be replicated and sustained; 4. Support public education and outreach that furthers the goal of protecting children and other vulnerable populations from housing-related health and safety hazards; 5. Build local capacity to operate sustainable programs that will prevent and control housing-related environmental health and safety hazards in low- and very low-income residences and develop a professional workforce that is trained in healthy homes assessment and remediation principles; 6. Promote integration of this grant program with housing rehabilitation, property maintenance, weatherization, healthy homes initiatives, other lead-based paint hazard control programs, other health and safety programs, and energy efficiency improvement activities and programs; 7. Build and enhance partner resources to develop the most promising, cost-effective methods for identifying and controlling key housing-related environmental health and safety hazards; 8. Promote collaboration, data sharing, and targeting between health and housing departments; 9. Ensure to the greatest extent feasible that job training, employment, contracting, and other economic opportunities generated by this grant will be directed to low- and very-low income persons, particularly those who are recipients of government assistance for housing, and to businesses that provide economic opportunities to low- and very low-income persons in the area in which the project is located.

34884,HUD,Department of Housing and Urban Development,HO," Purpose and Summary. The Jobs Plus program develops locally-based, job-driven approaches that increase earnings and advance employment outcomes through work readiness, employer linkages, job placement, educational advancement, technology skills, and financial literacy for residents of public housing. The place-based Jobs Plus program addresses poverty among public housing residents by incentivizing and enabling employment through earned income disregards for working residents and a set of services designed to support work including employer linkages, job placement and counseling, educational advancement, and financial counseling. Ideally, these incentives will saturate the target developments, building a culture of work and making working residents the norm. The Jobs Plus program comprises these three core components (further described below): Employment-Related Services Financial Incentives &#8211; Jobs Plus Earned Income Disregard (JPEID) Community Supports for Work Applicants are encouraged to develop key partnerships to connect participants with any other needed services to remove barriers to work. An Individualized Training and Services Plan (ITSP) should be developed for each participant to establish goals and service strategies, and to track progress. Background HUD, the Rockefeller Foundation, and MDRC, through a public-private partnership, designed and supported the Jobs Plus program model between 1998 and 2003. HUD has issued two separate evaluation reports on the demonstration, in an effort to identify and document the most promising approaches to increasing employment among families in public housing. Each evaluation showed ongoing positive effects for residents when the program was well-implemented and included the three core elements. More information on the findings can be found at http://www.mdrc.org/project/jobs-plus-community-revitalization-initiative-public-housing-families#overview. Employment-Related Services Successful applicants must partner with the local Workforce Development Boards (WDB) and American Job Center(s) (AJC/One-Stop) in their area to offer multiple employment-related services for residents with a range of employment needs. Local Labor Market Information (LMI) should be used both for initial planning and analysis of which employment opportunities are most available locally, and for monitoring ongoing trends. Program services provided on-site should include, but need not be limited to, the following: Career exploration/job readiness workshops Job search and job placement assistance Entrepreneurship workshops Work experience including on-the-job training, internships, pre-apprenticeships and Registered Apprenticeships (HUD encourages opportunities for residents to be paid while training) Facilitated connections to education and training opportunities Rapid re-employment if job loss occurs Proactive post-placement job retention support and career advancement coaching Access to computers, phones, fax, and copy machines and other supplies for participants&#8217; employment-related uses and adequate training on how to use these technologies To facilitate these employment services, applicants may consider having dedicated on-site workforce system staff to perform job developer and case manager functions. Job developers work directly with the business community to identify and create employment opportunities and act as liaisons with local employment agencies. Case managers work one-on-one with participants to guide them through the employment process and help them achieve employment-related goals. Financial Incentives &#8211; Jobs Plus Earned Income Disregard (JPEID) Successful applicants must also implement a financial incentive for program participants, known as the Jobs Plus Earned Income Disregard (JPEID). This component will neutralize any rent increase due to rising earned income for Jobs Plus participants, removing a major disincentive to employment. Rent incentives offered through JPEID will be reimbursed to the PHA via Jobs Plus appropriation, and should be included in the program budget. Any other compensation to the PHA for lost rent revenues, such as by the standard EID calculation in the Operating Fund, will be offset manually to prevent overpayment of HUD funds to grant recipients. Further guidance will be available at the time of the award. All residents in a Jobs Plus development are eligible to receive the JPEID benefit, even if they do not actively participate in other Jobs Plus Activities. But, in order to access JPEID, residents must sign up for the Jobs Plus program. Residents who previously used up some or all of their lifetime EID eligibility are eligible to receive the full JPEID benefit. When the Jobs Plus program ends, all rent will return to regular income-based at the time of the next rent recertification. Disregarded Amount. The JPEID excludes from the Family Rent calculation 100 percent of a participating resident&#8217;s incremental earned income for a period of up to 48 months, beginning on the date on which a public housing resident enrolls in the Jobs Plus program, and ending at the end of the grant period. Calculation of the JPEID. Once the JPEID is triggered for a resident their baseline income will not change for the duration of the term of the grant (so participants who enroll early may benefit from the JPEID longer than residents who enroll later). To facilitate reimbursements for rent revenue losses due to the JPEID, grantees must calculate and document each participant&#8217;s Family Rent at the time of each rent re-certification, both before and after the inclusion of any participating resident&apos;s incremental earned income. The difference between these two rents is the amount to be reimbursed to the PHA through JPEID (using Jobs Plus grant funds). These calculations must be provided to HUD when drawing reimbursement funds. As with any government benefit, an increase in earned income may cause the reduction or loss of other benefits that an individual was previously receiving. Grantees, through case management or other means, must be prepared to help residents understand the overall financial impact of an increase in earned income and the JPEID. It is also expected that grantees will encourage participants to take advantage of other financial work incentives they may be entitled to, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). Community Supports for Work Community Support for Work (CSW) is a core component of the Jobs Plus program, reflecting the goal of building a caring and cohesive public housing community that is strongly committed to supporting residents&#8217; progress towards economic security. PHAs are expected to develop a strategy to promote CSW and include that strategy in its workplan. The strategy should include multiple intentional and complementary steps to build CSW falling into two main categories: Activities that build a caring and cohesive public housing community. For Jobs Plus to be successful, PHA staff members need to trust residents, residents need to trust PHA staff, and ultimately residents need to trust each other. Activities to build trust, create a sense of community, build a sense of shared purpose, train residents leaders, build resident self-confidence, and reduce the social isolation of individual residents are all important for achieving this goal. Social activities that focus primarily on getting residents out of their units are helpful but not sufficient to achieve this goal. Informal and nontraditional activities that support residents&#8217; progress toward economic security. Through the Jobs Plus program, residents will have access to case management, job training, employment placement services, and the Jobs Plus Earned Income Disregard. This component of CSW focuses on steps that go above and beyond these formal Jobs Plus activities. Examples include residents helping other residents prepare their resumes and learn about new job openings, residents driving residents to job interviews and setting up carpooling arrangements, residents providing residents with motivational support and residents watching each other&#8217;s children during a job interview. Broadly communicated messages about the importance of work and how &#8220;work pays&#8221; also contribute to this component of CSW, as do motivational speakers, exposure to internal and external success stories, and the marketing of stories about residents&#8217; success in finding a job and moving up the career ladder. CSW is something that engages the entire public housing community and not merely the residents that choose to formally engage with the Jobs Plus program through the case management processes and job training programs. This includes not only residents but also PHA staff who are not otherwise involved in the Jobs Plus program, such as property management or maintenance staff who can encourage residents to participate in Jobs Plus. Successfully executing the formal parts of the Jobs Plus program will not, on its own, enable a PHA to achieve the full transformative potential of CSW. While the successful enrollment of a large share of residents in formal Jobs Plus activities will obviously be helpful in laying the groundwork for a broader sense of shared purpose, it is not enough. Intentional steps to foster community and encourage residents to help other residents are needed. Successful applicants will incorporate a robust engagement strategy for involving the residents in the targeted development and creating a working community where there is effective collaboration between the PHA and the residents. Engagement is more than signing up &#8211; sustained involvement in the program through effective communication among the resident population, leading to residents&apos; ownership of their own growth and experiences, and that of peers, will yield continued benefits for both participants and future residents of the development beyond the grant period. Program outreach should be directed towards residents at all points along the employment spectrum &#8211; from unemployed individuals with no work history to working, underemployed families with substantial work history. The application narrative should include strategies to target this wide range of potential participants and any barriers they might face, as well as strategies for retention. One key strategy for program retention should include the use of residents as Community Coaches.

35251,HUD,Department of Housing and Urban Development,HO,"Program DescriptionThe purpose of the Lead Based Paint Hazard Reduction (LHR) grant program is to assist states, cities, counties/parishes, Native American Tribes or other units of local government in undertaking comprehensive programs to identify and control lead-based paint hazards in eligible privately-owned rental or owner-occupied housing populations. 2. Program ObjectivesFunds will be awarded to applicants to accomplish the following objectives:a. Maximize the number of children under the age of six years protected from lead poisoning and the number of housing units where lead hazards are controlled;b. Target lead hazard control efforts in housing in which children less than 6 years of age are at greatest risk of lead poisoning (pre-1960), which both currently and historically has included children residing in low-income and minority neighborhoods, to reduce the risk of elevated blood lead levels in these children less;c. Utilize cost-effective lead hazard control methods and approaches that ensures the long-term safety of the building occupants;d. Build local capacity to safely and effectively address lead hazards during lead hazard control, and renovation, remodeling, and maintenance activities by appropriate trained and certified individuals;e. Develop comprehensive, community-based approaches to integrating this grant program within other local initiatives through public and private partnerships that address housing related health and safety hazards and or serve low income families with children under the age of 6;f. Affirmatively further fair housing and further environmental justice. Note that besides being an &#8220;objective&#8221; of this NOFA, the obligation to affirmatively further fair housing is also a civil rights related program requirement;g. Establish data sharing, and targeting between health and housing departments; Specifically, for the following required reporting data pieces: (ER Visits, Asthma Incidence, ect of enrolled applicants and general pop of target area)h. Establish and implement a detailed process of monitoring and ensuring that units made lead-safe units are affirmatively marketed, and priority given, to families with young children under the age of 6 years of age for up to three years;i. Direct Job training, employment, contracting, and other economic opportunities generated by this grant will be directed to low- and very-low income persons, particularly those who are recipients of government assistance for housing, and to businesses that provide economic opportunities to low- and very low-income persons in the area in which the project is located.

Comply with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (&#8220;Section 504&#8221;) and its implementing regulations at 24 CFR 8, and Titles II and III of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Each of these prohibits discrimination based on disability. Regarding the period for which landlords of rental housing treated under this grant program must give priority to families with a child under age 6, applicants should disregard Section I.A.1.2.8, on page 2, because it is superseded by Section III.F, bullet #1, on pages 25-26. Specifically, page 2&#8217;s &#8220;up to three years&#8221; is superseded by page 26&#8217;s &#8220;not less than 3 years&#8221; (in &#8220;the landlord shall give priority in renting units assisted under this section, for not less than 3 years following the completion of lead abatement activities, to families with a child under the age of six years&#8221;), which is from the law (Title X) establishing this grant program.

Supportive service centers will not be considered in this NOFA. Funding applied for under the capital grant component may be used for: (1) Remodeling or alteration of existing buildings; (2) acquisition of buildings, acquisition and rehabilitation of buildings; (3) new construction; and (4) acquisition of vans (in connection with a new Grant and Per Diem grant project) for outreach to and/or transportation for homeless veterans. Funding applied for under this Notice is authorized by the ``Homeless Veterans Comprehensive Assistance Act of 2001,&apos;&apos; Public Law 107-95, Sec. 5, codified as amended at 38 U.S.C. 2011, 2012, 2013, 2061, 2064. For eligibility criteria please refer to 38 CFR part 61. Capital grant applicants may not receive assistance to replace funds provided by any State or local government to assist homeless persons. Note: Applicants considering the use of Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC) in conjunction with the capital grants in this NOFA should take into account that these tax credits are often used for permanent housing projects. Permanent housing is not an eligible activity under VA&apos;s Homeless Providers Grant and Per Diem Program. Other issues such as site control, leases for residents, and using the grant funds as a loan may be problematic to applicants even if transitional housing is provided and upon review and discovery may result in the application being denied. A proposal for an existing project that seeks to shift its focus by changing the population being served or the precise mix of services being offered is not eligible for consideration. No more than 25 percent of housing and services available in projects funded through this grant program may be provided to clients who are not receiving those services as veterans. VA is pleased to issue this NOFA for the Homeless Providers Grant and Per Diem Program. The Department expects to award approximately $15 million under the capital grant component. Funding available under this NOFA is being offered to help offset the capital expenses of existing state and local governments, Indian Tribal Governments, faith-based, and community-based organizations that are capable of creating and providing supported transitional housing for homeless veterans. The District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, any territory or possession of the United States, are considered eligible entities under the definition of ``State&apos;&apos; in the Final Rule, Sec. 61.1 Definitions. Note, all organizations that are conditionally selected will be requested to submit the Second Submission portion of the application package. In order to be considered eligible for funding, organizations must demonstrate in the Second Submission firm commitments of match for 35% of the total project cost or the difference between the total project cost and what is requested from VA, whichever is greater. Per diem for these programs is requested in the grant application and may be paid at the time of grant project completion. It should be noted that VA per diem payment is limited to the applicant&apos;s cost of care per eligible veteran minus other sources of payments to the applicant for furnishing services to homeless veterans up to the per day rate VA pays for State Home[[Page 4311]]Domiciliary care. Awardees will be required to support their request for per diem payment with adequate fiscal documentation as to program income and expenses. Interested organizations should know that the vast majority of homeless veterans in this country suffer from mental illness or substance abuse disorders or are dually diagnosed with both mental illness and substance abuse disorders. In addition, many homeless veterans have serious medical problems. The recent events associated with the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) coupled with the Nation&apos;s returning OEF/OIF veterans further emphasizes the need for collaboration with VA medical centers, VA community-based outpatient clinics or other health care providers as well as with VA and other benefit providers as an important aspect of assuring that homeless veterans have access to appropriate health care services. VA considers this program an important part of our effort to end chronic homelessness among all veterans. It is important to be aware that VA places great emphasis on responsibility and accountability. VA has procedures in place to verify the completion of the capital grant as well as monitor services provided to homeless veterans and outcomes associated with the services provided in grant and per diem-funded programs. Applicants should be aware of the following: All awardees that are conditionally selected in response to this NOFA must meet the requirements of the current edition of the Life Safety Code of the National Fire Protection Association as it relates to their specific facility. Applicants should note that all facilities are to be protected throughout by an approved automatic sprinkler system unless a facility is specifically exempted under the Life Safety Code. Applicants should make consideration of this when submitting their capital grant applications. VA will conduct an inspection prior to awardees being able to submit request for per diem payment to ensure this requirement is met. Upon capital grant completion each program seeking per diem will have a liaison appointed from a nearby VA medical facility to provide oversight and monitor services provided to homeless veterans in the per diem-funded program. Monitoring will include at a minimum an annual review of each per diem program&apos;s progress toward meeting internal goals and objectives in helping veterans attain housing stability, adequate income support, and Self-Sufficiency as identified in each per diem program&apos;s original application. Monitoring will also include a review of the agency&apos;s income and expenses as they relate to this project to ensure per diem payment is accurate. Each per diem-funded program will participate in VA&apos;s national program monitoring and evaluation system administered by VA&apos;s Northeast Program Evaluation Center (NEPEC). NEPEC&apos;s monitoring procedures will be used to determine successful accomplishment of these housing outcomes for each per diem-funded program. Authority:Funding applied for under this Notice is authorized by the ``Homeless Veterans Comprehensive Assistance Act of 2001,&apos;&apos; Public Law 107-95, Sec. 5, codified as amended at 38 U.S.C. 2011, 2012, 2013, 2061, 2064. The program is implemented by the final rule codified at 38 CFR Part 61.0. The regulations can be found in their entirety in 38 CFR, Sec. 61.0 through 61.82. Funds made available under this Notice are subject to the requirements of those regulations. Allocation: Approximately $15 million is available for the capital grant component. Capital grant awards will be limited to transitional housing projects (service center programs will not be considered in this round). Vans must be directly connected to a new Grant and Per Diem Grant project and will be limited to one per project number. Per diem payments to capital grant recipients are subject to the availability of funds and recipients maintaining the program for which the grant was awarded. Funding Priorities: VA establishes the following funding priorities in order to: (1) Implement the provisions of Public Law 107-95 regarding geographical dispersion and non-duplication of service; and (2) bolster capacity in areas that are underserved by the Grant and Per Diem Program. These areas may have high populations of homeless veterans and limited services to address homeless veterans&apos; needs. These areas can include both urban and rural areas but may be particularly prevalent outside the high population areas. VA is offering to eligible applicants funding priorities for transitional housing and services to: (1) serve women and women with care of dependent children; (2) Indian Tribal Governments or non-profit agencies that will provide transitional housing and services on Indian Tribal Property and finally, VA is encouraging interested state and local governments and faith-based and community-based organizations to apply for funding under this NOFA. In this round of capital grant funding, VA expects to award funding to create approximately 1000 community-based supported housing beds. Funding priority 1. VA is offering the opportunity for providers who are willing to create new projects specifically for women and women with care of dependent children only, which are 30 beds or less. Of those eligible entities in the first funding priority, that are legally fundable, the highest scoring applicants will be funded first until approximately $2 million is awarded. Applicants not funded in this priority will be considered in the third funding priority. Should not enough eligible projects be funded under the first funding priority, funds not expended in this priority will fall to the third funding priority. Funding priority 2. VA is offering the opportunity to Indian Tribal Governments or non-profit agencies that will provide transitional housing and services on Indian Tribal Property to apply for funding under this NOFA to create transitional housing and services for homeless veterans. Eligible entities that are Indian Tribal Governments or non-profit agencies willing to provide transitional housing and services on Indian Tribal Property will be considered in the second funding priority as applicable. Of those eligible entities in the second funding priority, that are legally fundable, the highest scoring applicants will be funded first until approximately $1 million is awarded. Applicants not funded in this priority will be placed in the third funding priority. Should not enough eligible projects be funded under the second funding priority, funds not expended in this priority will fall to the third funding priority. Note: Non-profit agencies who apply under this priority will be required to provide a letter of assurance from the Indian Tribal Government that if funded the provision of service will occur on Indian Tribal Property. Funding priority 3. VA is encouraging interested state and local governments, faith-based and community-based organizations, as well as eligible entities located in the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or any territory or possession of the United States, to apply for funding under this NOFA to create transitional housing and services for all homeless veterans. Eligible entities that are state and local governments, Indian Tribal Governments, faith-based, and community-based organizations, or any territory or possession of the United States, will be considered in the third funding priority as applicable. Of those[[Page 4312]]eligible entities that are legally fundable, the highest-ranked applications for which funding is available, will be conditionally selected for eligibility to receive a capital grant in accordance with their ranked order until funding is expended (approximately $12 million). Methodology: VA will review all capital grant applications in response to this notice of funding availability as follows: VA will group the applicants into the funding priorities categories as applicable. Applicants will then be ranked within their respective funding category based on score and any ranking criteria set forth in that funding category only if the applicant scores at least 600 cumulative points and receives points under the criteria in paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e) and (i) of section 61.13. The highest-ranked application for which funding is available, within the highest funding category, will be conditionally selected in accordance with their ranked order until VA reaches the projected amount of funding for each category. If funds are still available after selection of those applications in the highest priority group VA will continue to conditionally select applicants in lower priority categories in accordance with the selection method set forth in the final rule Sec. 61.14. Application Requirements: Applicants must include a cover letter clearly stating under which funding priority they wish to be considered. Non-profit agencies who apply under funding priority two are required to provide a letter of assurance from the Indian Tribal Government that if funded the provision of service will occur on Indian Tribal Property. The grant application requirements will be specified in the application package. Applicants should be careful to complete the proper application package. Submission of the incorrect or incomplete application package will result in the application being rejected at threshold. The packages include all required forms and certifications. Selections will be made based on criteria described in the application, Final Rule, and NOFA. Applicants who are conditionally selected will be notified of any additional information needed to confirm or clarify information provided in the application. Applicants will then be notified of the deadline to submit such information. If an applicant is unable to meet any conditions for grant award within the specified time frame, VA reserves the right to not award funds and to use the funds available for other grant and per diem applicants."

VA is seeking, through this NOFA, to renew previous grant and per diem Special Need providers and their VA collaborative partners to continue to serve the Special Need veteran populations. No part of a Special Need grant may be used for any purpose that would change significantly the scope of the specific grant and per diem project for which a capital grant and per diem was awarded. As a part of the review process, VA will review the original project and subsequent renewals as listed in the previous Special Need applications to ensure significant scope changes do not occur displacing other homeless veteran populations. VA may reject for Special Need Funding those applications that significantly alter the original scope (38 CFR Section 61.62). A separate Special Need application is required for each previously funded grant and per diem project (identified by unique project number (see Application Requirements in this NOFA). Special Need funding may not be used for capital improvements or to purchase vans or real property. However, the leasing of vans or real property may be acceptable. Questions regarding acceptability should be directed to VA&apos;s Grant and Per Diem Field Office (at the number listed above). Applicants may not receive Special Need Assistance to replace funds provided by any Federal, state or local government agency or program to assist homeless persons.

The goal is to the maximum extent possible ensure a continuation of Special Need services to homeless veterans and their VA collaborative partners. It is important to be aware that VA places great emphasis on responsibility and accountability.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This notice announces the availability of funds for assistance under VA&apos;s Homeless Providers Grant and Per Diem Program for eligible non-profit entities with expertise in preparing grant applications relating to the provision of assistance for homeless veterans to: Provide technical assistance to those non-profit community-based groups with experience in providing assistance to homeless veterans in order to help such groups apply for grants under the final rule, published in the Federal Register, September 26, 2003, or to apply for other grants from any source for addressing the problems of homeless veterans. Funding applied for under this Notice is authorized by the ``Homeless Veterans Comprehensive Assistance Act of 2001,&apos;&apos; Public Law 107-95, Sec. 5, codified as amended at 38 U.S.C. 2011, 2012, 2013, 2061, 2064. The program is implemented by the final rule codified at 38 CFR Part 61.0. The regulations can be found in their entirety in 38 CFR, Sec. 61.0 through 61.82. Funds made available under this Notice are subject to the requirements of those regulations. Funding applied for under this notice may be used for: (a) Group or individual seminars providing general instructions concerning grant applications; (b) Group or individual seminars providing instructions for applying for a specific grant; or (c) Group or individual instruction for preparing analyses to be included in a grant application. Seminars (course of instruction) may be delivered in electronic, face-to-face (individual or group), and correspondence methodologies (e.g., Internet based training, video teleconferencing, computer media such as CD or disk). VA&apos;s statutory authority is limited to providing grants so that the recipients ``shall provide technical assistance to non-profit community-based groups with experience in providing assistance to homeless veterans in order to assist such groups in applying for grants under this chapter and other grants relating to addressing problems of homeless veterans&apos;&apos; (38 U.S.C. 2064). Potential applicants should take this into consideration when developing technical assistance applications to ensure their activities as described in the application meet the regulatory criteria of aiding potential non-profits by providing general instructions concerning grant applications, instruction on completing specific grant applications, or providing analyses to be used in grant applications (38 CFR 61.50 (a), (b), (c)). Entities that are interested in providing technical assistance should be aware that historically the Grant and Per Diem Program office receives over 1,500 nationwide inquiries per Notice of Fund Availability (NOFA) from prospective applicants. It is estimated that an additional 1,000 inquiries are received nationwide at VA Medical Center Homeless Programs. From these inquiries, VA has seen an increase in the number of applicants each year. Approximately 100 to 300 applications per funding round have been received in past responses to NOFAs under VA&apos;s Homeless Providers Grant and Per Diem Program. Those entities applying to provide technical assistance should consider not only the numbers but the diversity of the service provider seeking assistance when establishing their service plans. The applicant for this funding will be expected to develop an integrated technical assistance plan, using funds for purposes as specified in this NOFA, the objectives of the program rules and regulations to offer technical assistance to agencies in their- specified target area. Applicants should take note that they will be held accountable to provide to VA documentation that demonstrates the objectives of technical training are being met throughout the course of the award cycle and documentation that clearly demonstrates the completion of technical assistance objectives were met, cumulatively, at the end of the funding period. Also, VA intends to conduct both periodic fiscal and performance reviews of the awarded agency(s). The technical assistance should not only raise the awareness of providers regarding the availably of funds to assist homeless veterans but also increase providers&apos; proficiency in applying for these funds to assist homeless veterans. Applicants should take the aforementioned into consideration when developing a technical assistance plan. Outcomes measures that are specific and measurable should be an integral part of the technical assistance plan that is submitted in the application. Grant applicants may not receive assistance to replace funds provided by any State or local government for the same purpose. Authority: Funding applied for under this Notice is authorized by the ``Homeless Veterans Comprehensive Assistance Act of 2001,&apos;&apos; Public Law 107-95, Sec. 5, codified as amended at 38 U.S.C. 2011, 2012, 2013, 2061, 2064. The program is implemented by the final rule codified at 38 CFR Part 61.0. The regulations can be found in their entirety in 38 CFR, Sec. 61.0 through 61.82. Funds made available under this Notice are subject to the requirements of those regulations. Allocation: Approximately $3 million is available for the technical assistance grant component of this program. Funding will be for a period beginning on October 1, 2009 and ending on September 30, 2011. Not more than $500,000.00 per year per technical assistance provider will be awarded. Applicants should take into consideration the 24-month period of award when calculating and submitting their budgets for this NOFA. Funding Priorities: Feedback from previous technical assistance users&apos; and documented outcomes from previous technical assistance providers indicates a demand and preference for face-to-face group seminars to deliver technical assistance information. In order to meet this demand VA establishes the following funding priorities. Funding priority 1. Eligible entities that will provide 45 face-to- face group grant writing seminars, nationwide, per year, specific to the Grant / Per Diem Program will be placed in funding priority one. With these criteria, of those eligible entities in the first funding priority, that are legally fundable, the highest scoring applicant will be funded first followed by the second highest scoring applicant until $1 million is funded. Of this group not more than one (1) technical assistance grant will be awarded to the same technical assistance recipient (defined by tax identification number). Using the guidance above, should the goal not be met and if funding is still available, remaining funding will go to the second funding priority. Funding priority 2. Should funding still be available, eligible entities providing general technical assistance activities as stated in the regulations will be placed in the second funding priority. Of this group not more than one (1) technical assistance grant will be awarded to the same technical assistance recipient (defined by tax identification number). Of those eligible entities in the second funding priority, that are legally fundable, the highest scoring applicants will be funded first until funding is expended. Application Requirements: Applicants must provide a cover letter indicating which funding priority they are applying under. The specific grant application requirements will be specified in the application package. The package includes all required forms and certifications. Selections will be made based on criteria described in the application. Applicants who are selected will be notified of any additional information needed to confirm or clarify information provided in the application. Applicants will then be notified of the time in which to submit such information. If an applicant is unable to meet any conditions for grant award within the specified time frame, VA reserves the right to not award funds and to use the funds available for other grant and per diem applicants."
37472,USDA-CSREE,CSREES,HO,"The purpose of Pest Management Alternatives Program (PMAP) is to provide support for and encourage the development and implementation of integrated pest management (IPM) practices, tactics, and systems for specific pest problems while reducing human and environmental risks. This purpose addresses the broader &quot;National Roadmap for Integrated Pest Management,&quot; (http://www.ipmcenters.org/Docs/IPMRoadMap.pdf).The successful management of pest problems in commercial production is facing severe challenges due to regulatory changes, emergence of new pest problems, and the development of pest resistance to present management technologies.

37732,HUD,Department of Housing and Urban Development,HO," The purpose of this assistance is to continue investing in the creation and maintenance of a professional and effective housing counseling industry that is able to meaningfully assist consumers by providing them with the information they need to make informed housing choices, and maximizes the impact of Federal funding appropriated for HUD&#8217;s Housing Counseling Program. HUD recognizes six (6) Core Topics in which housing counselors need to be competent. These are: 1. Financial Management; 2. Property Maintenance; 3. Homeownership and Tenancy; 4. Fair Housing and other Civil Rights Laws and Requirements 5. Housing Affordability; 6. Avoidance of, and responses to, rental and mortgage delinquency and avoidance of eviction and mortgage default. HUD recognizes that counselors may specialize in specific housing counseling topics, and that generally counselors will need more than general housing counseling training in order to provide high quality services that include general and specialized housing counseling topics. This NOFA provides notice of a grant program that supports the provision of both basic housing counseling training and specialized topics of training to help meet these perceived needs. This financial support will assist housing counseling agencies to increase the use of partnerships with local and state-wide organizations to provide additional place based training on state and local issues. In addition, this support should result in an increased number of training scholarships. Statutory requirements enacted in 2010 state that individual housing counselors participating in HUD&#8217;s Housing Counseling Program shall demonstrate, by written examination, that they are competent in providing counseling in each of the core topics. HUD has developed regulations to address the statutory requirements for counselor certification and continues to encourages housing counselors to seek education on these topics following publication of the final rule.

47372,USAID-TAN,Tanzania USAID-Dar es Salaam,HO,"The purpose of award arising out of this solicitation is to strengthen the ability of civil society organizations (CSOs) and CSO networks to produce and report on measurable results in combating HIV and AIDS. These organizations are on a continuum of embryonic, small, rural-based CSOs to more mature, larger, urban-based CSOs that in some way contribute to the functioning of the health system in Tanzania. Civil society organizations include a wide range of non-state actors, such as non-government organizations (NGOs), print and broadcast media, religious groups, labor unions, academic institutions, consulting firms and for-profit private companies. Organizational capacity is the ability of organizations to produce results effectively and efficiently. Capacity building is the process of helping organizations to do this by strengthening their ability to perform their core functions, identify and solve problems, adapt to unforeseen changes, and seize opportunities through strategic planning and accurate monitoring and evaluation of the environment. While the target CSOs for this capacity building activity primarily are NGOs working in the health sector and specifically on producing measurable results in combating HIV/AIDS, other CSOs also will be important partners and beneficiaries."

Planning and Action Grants are three and a half year planning grants that pair planning with action. Experience shows that tangible actions taken early on help communities build momentum for further planning and the eventual transition from planning to implementation of that plan. These actions improve neighborhood confidence, which in turn sustains the community?s energy, attracts more engagement and resources, and helps convince skeptical stakeholders that positive change is possible. Under these grants, the planning process activities would take place during the first 24 months of the grant period. The planning process will identify Action Activities that will be carried out during the latter portion of the grant period. Action Activities must build upon the planning for the target housing and neighborhood."

49501,HUD,Department of Housing and Urban Development,HO,"This Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) announces the availability of Indian Housing Block Grant (IHBG)--Competitive Grants. The IHBG program is authorized under Title I of the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996, as amended, (25 U.S.C. 4101 et seq.) (NAHASDA). Under the program, eligible Indian tribes and tribally-designated housing entities (TDHEs) receive grants to carry out a range of affordable housing activities. Grant funds may be used to develop, maintain, and operate affordable housing in safe and healthy environments on Indian reservations and in other Indian areas, and carry out other affordable housing activities. Grant funds must be used to primarily benefit low-income Indian families. In the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 (Appropriations Acts), Congress provided a total of $200,000,000 for competitive grants to eligible IHBG recipients authorized under NAHASDA in addition to formula-based funding. This NOFA describes the criteria that HUD will use to award IHBG Competitive grants, and outlines program requirements. Consistent with the Appropriations Acts, HUD intends to transfer $2 million to the Program Office Salaries and Expenses&#8211;Public and Indian Housing account for the administration and oversight of grants awarded under this NOFA. In January 2017, HUD released a study entitled, &#8220;Housing Needs of American Indians and Alaska Natives in Tribal Areas: A Report From the Assessment of American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian Housing Needs.&#8221; Among the findings, the study found that tribal households are substantially worse than other U.S. households, with overcrowding in tribal areas being especially severe. The study noted that in the 2013-2015 period alone, 68,000 new units would have been necessary to help eliminate overcrowding and replace physically deteriorating units. Additional information is available at: https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/public_indian_housing/ih/codetalk/onap/hsingstudy. The Department recognizes that this additional IHBG funding provides a rare opportunity to fund strong and viable affordable housing projects in Indian Country. These projects could begin to address the concerns identified in the study. In accordance with the Appropriations Acts, HUD will give priority to projects that spur construction and rehabilitation, while considering need and administrative capacity. HUD strongly encourages new affordable housing construction projects that will increase the number of housing units available for low-income Indian families and help address the housing shortage in Indian Country. Additionally, HUD encourages housing rehabilitation projects that will increase the useful life of existing affordable housing units and alleviate substandard housing conditions. HUD also encourages necessary affordable housing-related infrastructure projects that will enable future construction or rehabilitation. While HUD will give funding priority for new construction projects, rehabilitation projects, and related necessary infrastructure projects, applicants may also apply for funding to carry out other eligible activities under NAHASDA. Finally, Indian tribes and TDHEs that are applying for funding under this NOFA are encouraged to propose projects that are part of a comprehensive plan to address housing conditions in their communities, including overcrowding and physically deteriorating units, as appropriate. Applicants should also engage in long-term planning and ensure that the project being proposed is part of a holistic plan that considers planned future infrastructure development, economic development opportunities, and more. All applications received through this NOFA and pass application screening and threshold review will be rated. Funds will be awarded in rank order based on the score received on the application submitted under this NOFA, starting with FY 2018 funds and continuing with FY 2019 funds. HUD reserves the right to issue a supplemental or independent NOFA if necessary (e.g., to ensure that all appropriated funds are awarded). Grantees must comply with the requirements of NAHASDA and 24 CFR part 1000. The Office of Native American Programs (ONAP) within HUD&#8217;s Office of Public and Indian Housing will administer this program."

Statutory requirements enacted in 2010 state that individual housing counselors participating in HUD&#8217;s Housing Counseling Program shall demonstrate, by written examination, that they are competent in providing counseling in each of the core topics. HUD published the Final Rule for Housing Counseling Certification December 14, 2016. This rule implements statutory requirements that housing counseling required under or provided in connection with all HUD programs must be provided by HUD certified agencies and HUD certified housing counselors. HUD recognizes six (6) Core Topics in which housing counselors need to be competent. These are: Financial Management; Property Maintenance; Homeownership and Tenancy; Fair Housing and other Civil Rights Laws and Requirements; Housing Affordability; Avoidance of, and responses to, rental and mortgage delinquency and avoidance of eviction and mortgage default. HUD also acknowledges the need for more housing counselors trained in HECM default counseling. According to HUD&#8217;s Annual Report to Congress on the FHA Mutual Mortgage Insurance (MMI) Fund for FY2017, the HECM portfolio has been a substantial economic drain on the MMI Fund. The Annual Report to Congress for FY2018 noted the Capital Ratio for the HECM portfolio is negative 18.83 percent, a further decline from the restated negative 18.30 percent for FY 2017. HUD recognizes the important role housing counselors can provide in helping to mitigate HECM defaults and foreclosures and decrease losses to the MMI Fund. This assistance will expand the number of agencies and counselors who can provide default counseling for Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) borrowers. Current HUD priorities also center on Disaster Preparation and Recovery. Housing counseling agencies (HCA&apos;s) are in a unique position to help their communities prepare for and recover from a disaster. They can help their clients prepare for disasters by integrating preparedness into their counseling and education activities. Post-disaster, they can use their knowledge of local resources and programs to help clients navigate the complexities of disaster recovery resources and programs. This NOFA supports courses that provide training in the areas of disaster preparation and recovery. HUD recognizes that counselors may specialize in specific housing counseling topics, and that counselors will need more than general housing counseling training in order to provide high quality services that include general and specialized housing counseling topics. This NOFA provides notice of a grant program that supports the provision of both basic housing counseling training and specialized topics of training including training in the core topics for housing counselor certification, HECM default counseling and disaster preparation and recovery to help meet these perceived needs. This financial support will assist housing counseling agencies to increase the use of partnerships with local and state-wide organizations to provide additional place-based training on state and local issues. In addition, this support should result in an increased number of training scholarships."

The NOFA will contain information concerning the SSVF Program, initial and renewal supportive services grant application processes, and amount of funding available. For a Copy of the Letter of Intent Format: Download directly from the SSVF Program web page which can be found at www.va.gov/homeless/ssvf.asp. Questions should be referred to the SSVF Program Office via phone at (877) 737-0111 (this is a toll-free number) or via email at SSVF@va.gov. For detailed SSVF Program information and requirements, see title 38 CFR Part 62. Submission of Letter of Intent: Letters of intent should be submitted electronically to the SSVF Program Office via email at SSVF@va.gov. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This letter of intent is requested in anticipation of a planned NOFA to be issued in FY 2013. Please refer to title 38 CFR Part 62 for detailed SSVF Program information and requirements. A. Purpose: The SSVF Program&#146;s purpose is to provide supportive services grants to private non-profit organizations and consumer cooperatives who will coordinate or provide supportive services to very low-income Veteran families who are residing in permanent housing, are homeless and scheduled to become residents of permanent housing within a specified time period, or after exiting permanent housing, are seeking other housing that is responsive to such very low-income veteran family&#146;s needs and preferences. B. Definitions: Sections 62.2 and 62.11(a) of title 38, Code of Federal Regulations, contain definitions of terms used in the SSVF Program. C. Approach: Grantees will be expected to leverage supportive services grant funds to enhance the housing stability of very low-income Veteran families who are occupying permanent housing. In doing so, grantees are required to establish relationships with local community resources. The aim of the provision of supportive services is to assist very low-income veteran families. Accordingly, VA encourages eligible entities skilled in facilitating housing stability and currently operating rapid re- &#8195; housing programs (i.e., administering the Department of Housing and Urban Development&#146;s (HUD) Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Re-Housing Program, HUD&#146;s Emergency Solution Grant, or other comparable Federal or community resources) to apply for supportive services grants. The SSVF Program is not intended to provide long-term support for participants, nor will it be able to address all of the financial and supportive services needs of participants that affect housing stability. Rather, when participants require long-term support, grantees should focus on connecting such participants to mainstream Federal and community resources (e.g., HUD-VA Supportive Housing Program, HUD Housing Choice Voucher programs, McKinney-Vento funded supportive housing programs, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, etc.) that can provide ongoing support. Assistance in obtaining or retaining permanent housing is a fundamental goal of the SSVF Program. Grantees are expected to provide case management services in accordance with 38 CFR 62.21. D. Authority: The SSVF Program is authorized by title 38 U.S.C. 2044, amended by the Veterans Health Care Facilities Capital Improvement Act of 2011, Public Law 112-37. VA implements the SSVF program by regulation in title 38 CFR Part 62. "

The rights to freedom of association, collective bargaining, and other worker protections are under threat in many parts of the world. At the same time, the de-standardization of employment has resulted in new forms of workers&#8217; rights violations. These negative trends affect the labor sector and workers globally, including youth employed in the gig economy, exploited migrant workers, outsourced industrial workers, and disguised employment in agriculture and the informal economy. USAID therefore seeks strategic and innovative approaches to reach low-wage and vulnerable workers, including those who have been excluded from formal union membership, such as domestic workers and agricultural workers, and across the informal labor sector. &#65279;For the new Global Labor Initiative (GLI), the DRG Center intends to take a more innovative and inclusive design approach to increase the number and diversify the types of organizations involved in the planning and implementation of the program.

The Department acknowledges that great variation exists in the quality of fair housing testing performed by FHIP grantees. Some grantees have consistently demonstrated that testing produces strong evidence that can be used to forge effective legal challenges to discriminatory housing practices. Still some grantees exhibit lesser capabilities and uneven or less accomplished tracs. HUD recognizes the need to improve and standardized the quality of testing provided by testers employed by FHIP grantees.

The Healthy Homes Production (HHP) Program is part of HUD&#8217;s overall Healthy Homes Initiative launched in 1999. The program takes a comprehensive approach to addressing multiple childhood diseases and injuries in the home by focusing on housing-related hazards in a coordinated fashion, rather than addressing a single hazard at a time. The program builds upon HUD&#8217;s experience with Lead Hazard Control programs to expand the Department&#8217;s efforts to address a variety of high-priority environmental health and safety hazards. Applicants receiving an award will be expected to accomplish the following objectives: 1. Maximize both the number of vulnerable residents (children, elderly) protected from housing-related environmental health and safety hazards and the number of housing units where these hazards are controlled; 2. Identify and remediate priority housing-related health and safety hazards in privately owned, low-income rental and/or owner occupied housing, especially in units and/or buildings where children and elderly reside; 3. Promote cost-effective and efficient healthy home methods and approaches that can be replicated and sustained; 4. Support public education and outreach that furthers the goal of protecting children and other vulnerable populations from housing-related health and safety hazards; 5. Build local capacity to operate sustainable programs that will prevent and control housing-related environmental health and safety hazards in low- and very low-income residences and develop a professional workforce that is trained in healthy homes assessment and remediation principles; 6. Promote integration of this grant program with housing rehabilitation, property maintenance, weatherization, healthy homes initiatives, other lead-based paint hazard control programs, other health and safety programs, and energy efficiency improvement activities and programs; 7. Build and enhance partner resources to develop the most promising, cost-effective methods for identifying and controlling key housing-related environmental health and safety hazards; 8. Promote collaboration, data sharing, and targeting between health and housing departments; 9.

This NOFA describes the criteria that HUD will use to award IHBG Competitive grants, and outlines program requirements. Consistent with the Appropriations Acts, HUD intends to transfer up to $1 million to the Program Office&#8211;Public and Indian Housing account for the administration and oversight of grants awarded under this NOFA. In January 2017, HUD released a study entitled, &#8220;Housing Needs of American Indians and Alaska Natives in Tribal Areas: A Report from the Assessment of American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian Housing Needs.&#8221; Among the findings, the study found that tribal households are substantially worse than other U.S. households, with overcrowding in tribal areas being especially severe. The study noted that in the 2013-2015 period alone, 68,000 new units would have been necessary to help eliminate overcrowding and replace physically deteriorating units. Additional information is available at: https://www.huduser.gov/portal/pdredge/pdr-edge-research-022117.html The Department recognizes that this additional IHBG funding provides an opportunity to fund strong and viable affordable housing projects in Indian Country. These projects could begin to address the concerns identified in the study. In accordance with the Appropriations Act, HUD will give priority to projects that spur construction and rehabilitation, while considering need and administrative capacity. HUD strongly encourages new affordable housing construction projects that will increase the number of housing units available for low-income Indian families and help address the housing shortage in Indian Country. Additionally, HUD encourages housing rehabilitation projects that will increase the useful life of existing affordable housing units and alleviate substandard housing conditions. HUD also encourages acquisition of existing housing units that increases housing stock and necessary affordable housing-related infrastructure projects that will enable future construction or rehabilitation. While HUD will give funding priority for new construction projects, rehabilitation projects, acquisition of units and necessary affordable housing-related infrastructure projects, applicants may also apply for funding to carry out other eligible activities under NAHASDA. Finally, Indian tribes and TDHEs that are applying for funding under this NOFA are encouraged to propose projects that are part of a comprehensive plan to address housing conditions in their communities, including overcrowding and physically deteriorating units, as appropriate. Applicants should also engage in long-term planning and ensure that the project being proposed is part of a holistic plan that considers planned future infrastructure development, economic development opportunities, and more. All applications received through this NOFA that pass application screening and threshold review will be rated. Funds will be awarded in rank order based on the score received on the application submitted under this NOFA. HUD reserves the right to issue a supplemental or independent NOFA if necessary (e.g., to ensure that all appropriated funds are awarded). Grantees must comply with the requirements of NAHASDA and 24 CFR part 1000. The Office of Native American Programs (ONAP) within HUD&#8217;s Office of Public and Indian Housing will administer this program."

66261,HUD,Department of Housing and Urban Development,HO,"The Tribal HUD-VA Supportive Housing (Tribal HUD-VASH) demonstration program was established under the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (Public Law 113-235, approved December 16, 2014) (2015 Appropriations Act), and provides grants to Indian Tribes and Tribally Designated Housing Entities (TDHEs) eligible to receive block grants under the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 (NAHASDA). Grantees use funding towards rental assistance and supportive services for Native American Veterans who are homeless or at risk of homelessness, living on or near a reservation or other Indian areas. Under Tribal HUD-VASH, Indian Tribes and TDHEs must partner with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to provide case management and supportive services, including healthcare assistance, to eligible Native American Veterans. On March 2, 2016, HUD published a Federal Register Notice (81 FR 10880) entitled &#8220;Tribal HUD&#8211;VA Supportive Housing Program Awards, Fiscal Year 2015&#8221; notifying the public regarding HUD&#8217;s funding decisions under the Tribal HUD-VASH program for Fiscal Year 2015. In total, 26 Indian Tribes and TDHEs were selected to participate in the demonstration program. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (Pub. L. 115-31, approved May 5, 2017) (2017 Appropriations Act) provided HUD with $7 million for the Tribal HUD-VASH demonstration program. Congress directed HUD to use this funding to provide renewal grants to the original Indian Tribes and TDHEs that received funding under the demonstration program. After awarding renewal funding, Congress authorized HUD to use any remaining amounts appropriated to fund new grants. In September 2018, HUD provided the original 26 Indian Tribes and TDHEs participating in the program with $3,765,568 of the $7 million in renewal funding. In accordance with the 2017 Appropriations Act, this NOFA establishes the criteria HUD will use to award the remaining $3,234,432 for new grants. The 2017 Appropriations Act requires HUD to make awards based on need and administrative capacity. On June 3, 2019, HUD issued a &#8220;Dear Tribal Leader&#8221; letter (https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/PIH/documents/Tribal%20Vash%20Expansion%20June%203.pdf) to all tribal leaders and TDHEs. The letter sought tribal feedback on how HUD should assess need and administrative capacity. HUD proposed awarding new grants to some of the original Indian Tribes/TDHEs already participating in the program that demonstrated the capacity to administer the program effectively and that have unmet need for housing and supportive services for eligible Veterans. HUD also proposed awarding new grants through a competition to expand the Tribal HUD-VASH program to new Indian Tribes and TDHEs. HUD recognizes the overall, severe affordable housing shortage in Indian Country. In January 2017, HUD released a study entitled &#8220;Housing Needs of American Indians and Alaska Natives in Tribal Areas: A Report From the Assessment of American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian Housing Needs.&#8221; Among the findings, the study found that tribal households are substantially worse than other U.S. households, with overcrowding in tribal areas being especially severe. The study noted that in the 2013-2015 period alone, 68,000 new units would have been necessary to help eliminate overcrowding and replace physically deteriorating units. Additional information and subsequent reports are available at https://www.huduser.gov/portal/pdredge/pdr-edge-research-022117.html. Given these considerations and based on feedback received from the &#8220;Dear Tribal Leader&#8221; letter, HUD is using this opportunity to award new Tribal HUD-VASH grants to address both the concerns identified in the study and to provide housing assistance and supportive services to Native American Veterans who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. Since the 2017 Appropriations Act also requires HUD to coordinate with the VA when awarding new grants under the program, the Departments met throughout the planning process and jointly established the rating factors and requirements detailed in this NOFA. These were driven based on HUD and VA&apos;s experiences to-date, including assessing the demonstration program&apos;s achievements, areas for improvement, and feedback from both HUD-Office of Native American Programs (ONAP) and VA case managers. As such, HUD and VA remain committed to providing critical case management services and technical assistance, both for existing grantees and the additional Indian Tribes and TDHEs based on this competition. This NOFA announces the availability of the remaining $3,234,432 in FY 2017 funding for new Tribal HUD-VASH grants to both Indian Tribes and TDHEs currently participating in the demonstration program, and to eligible Indian Tribes and TDHEs that have not previously received a Tribal HUD-VASH grant. HUD will give priority to applicants that demonstrate the capacity to leverage other funding sources to increase the number of new housing units available for eligible Veterans under the program. HUD invites applicants to apply for this funding opportunity in accordance with the criteria established in this NOFA. "

Funding for grants awarded under this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) is made available through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, 2020 (the CARES Act; P.L. 116-136). Mounting risks posed to vulnerable populations from public health concerns such as the coronavirus and other infectious diseases show a need to increase safety in transitional housing provided by GPD grantees. This funding will allow current GPD grantees to improve the transitional housing they offer to Veterans resulting in less congregate housing and more individual unit style housing. This funding will improve personal safety for Veterans, reduce risks associated with close quarters living and increase the availability of individual unit style transitional housing. This funding will allow GPD grantees to continue to transform programs and to meet the challenges local communities face when providing safe spaces for Veterans experiencing homelessness.DATES:Applications for grants must be received by the GPD National Program Office no later than 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time on May 25, 2021.In the interest of fairness to all, this deadline is firm as to date and hour.

PurposeIn response to the President&#8217;s March 2020 National Emergency declaration related to COVID&#8211;19, VA announces the availability of approximately $50 million in capital grants to increase safety and reduce risk for Veterans in GPD transitional housing who otherwise would be experiencing homelessness. Mounting risks posed to vulnerable populations from public health concerns such as the coronavirus and other infectious diseases show a need to increase safety in transitional housing provided by GPD grantees.This funding will allow current GPD grantees to improve the transitional housing they offer to Veterans resulting in less congregate housing and more individual unit style housing. This funding will improve personal safety for Veterans, reduce risks associated with close quarters living and increase the availability of individual unit style transitional housing. This funding will allow GPD grantees to continue to transform programs and to meet the challenges local communities face when providing safe spaces for Veterans experiencing homelessness.Funding is offered to current GPD grantees only. For purposes of this NOFO, a current GPD grantee is an organization that successfully applied to NOFO VA-GPD-PDO-FY2020 and received a new GPD Per Diem Only (PDO) grant with an award date of October 1, 2020, and with an end date of September 30, 2021, and that is eligible for an option year award starting October 1, 2021. For purposes of this NOFO, a current GPD grantee includes PDO transitional housing projects. For purposes of this NOFO, a current GPD grantee does not include GPD grantees with only a PDO Service Center grant, Transition in Place (TIP) grant, Special Need grant or Case Management grant unless they also have an active PDO transitional housing grant.The purpose of this NOFO is to provide capital grants to support acquisition, construction or rehabilitation of real property used for GPD transitional housing facilities. Funds provided through this NOFO are not to support per diem costs, services costs or the cost of operating transitional housing beds for Veterans.Eligibility is summarized here and discussed in detail in the Eligibility section of this NOFO:Applicants, as defined by Employer Identification Number (EIN), are limited to one application per currently active GPD PDO grant per VA medical facility catchment area.&#8226; Applications must be from the same organization with the same Employer Identification Number (EIN) as is associated with the currently active GPD PDO Federal Award Identifying Number (FAIN).&#8226; Each application must be for the improvement of some or all the GPD beds currently associated with the active GPD PDO grant. Temporary sites (e.g., sites not under the applicant&#8217;s direct ownership or control such as motels being used as a temporary measure during the COVID-19 National Emergency) are not eligible for improvement under this NOFO. See Payment section of the NOFO for site control requirements.&#8226; Each application may request no more than $50,000 total costs per GPD bed that, upon completion of the project, will be changed from a bed in a shared space to a bed in a private room (with a private bath).&#8226; Each application may request no more than $2.5 million total costs per application.&#8226; The number of beds proposed to be changed from a bed in a shared space to a bed in a private room (with a private bath) with funds from this capital grant may be less than, but must not exceed, the total number of beds authorized under the GPD PDO grant. NOTE: For grantees with GPD beds in spaces that flex over time, the maximum number of beds proposed to be changed under this capital grant must not exceed the average number of GPD beds documented over the 3 months prior to the NOFO publication month.&#8226; Upon completion of the project, the GPD beds changed from a bed in a shared space to a bed in a private room (with a private bath) must continue to be in the same VA medical facility catchment area as the active GPD PDO grant. A change in VA medical facility catchment areas is not allowed. Applicants proposing sites that are within the VA medical facility catchment area, but are a significant distance from their current location, must describe in the Abstract section of the application how they will address relevant impacts (e.g., proximity to VA, employment, transportation). Applicants are reminded that they must continue to provide the same level (or better) of staffing and services as described in their FY 2020 PDO application, or as modified through an approved change of scope.Applicants are encouraged to consider the responsibilities they assume if they are funded and to carefully request only the changes to beds and dollar amounts that correspond to the responsibility, they are willing to assume. Specifically, successful applicants are subject to the recovery provisions of 38 C.F.R. 61.67. VA will seek recovery for awarded capital grant funds on a prorated basis if at any time during the minimum operational period a grantee no longer has an active GPD PDO grant and/or if a grantee does not maintain bed numbers. Applicants should become familiar with the amount of time the PDO project must operate in order to avoid capital grant repayments. Operational time for these grants will begin on the activation date (i.e., not the award date, but the date GPD approves activation after project completion; see definition of &#8220;activation date&#8221; later in the NOFO). For details, refer to the table at the end of this NOFO and the regulations."

70970,HUD,Department of Housing and Urban Development,HO,"The IHBG program is authorized under Title I of the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996, as amended, (25 U.S.C. 4101 et seq.) (NAHASDA). Under the program, eligible Indian tribes and tribally designated housing entities (TDHEs) receive grants to carry out a range of affordable housing activities. Grant funds may be used to develop, maintain, and operate affordable housing in safe and healthy environments on Indian reservations and in other Indian areas and carry out other affordable housing activities. Grant funds must be used to primarily benefit low-income Indian families. In the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 (Appropriations Act) (Public Law 116-156), Congress provided a total of $100,000,000 for competitive grants to eligible IHBG recipients authorized under NAHASDA in addition to formula-based funding. This NOFO describes the criteria that HUD will use to award IHBG Competitive grants, and outlines program requirements. In January 2017, HUD released a study entitled, &#8220;Housing Needs of American Indians and Alaska Natives in Tribal Areas: A Report from the Assessment of American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian Housing Needs.&#8221; Among the findings, the study found that tribal households are substantially worse than other U.S. households, with overcrowding in tribal areas being especially severe. The study noted that in the 2013-2015 period alone, 68,000 new units would have been necessary to help eliminate overcrowding and replace physically deteriorating units. Additional information is available at: https://www.huduser.gov/portal/pdredge/pdr-edge-research-022117.html The Department recognizes that this additional IHBG funding provides an opportunity to fund strong and viable affordable housing projects in Indian Country. These projects could begin to address the concerns identified in the study. In accordance with the Appropriations Act, HUD will give priority to projects that spur construction and rehabilitation, while considering need and administrative capacity. HUD strongly encourages new affordable housing construction projects that will increase the number of housing units available for low-income Indian families and help address the housing shortage in Indian Country. Additionally, HUD encourages housing rehabilitation projects that will increase the useful life of existing affordable housing units and alleviate substandard housing conditions. HUD also encourages acquisition of existing housing units that increases housing stock and necessary affordable housing-related infrastructure projects that will enable future construction or rehabilitation. While HUD will give funding priority for new construction projects, rehabilitation projects, acquisition of units and necessary affordable housing-related infrastructure projects, applicants may also apply for funding to carry out other eligible activities under NAHASDA. Finally, Indian tribes and TDHEs that are applying for funding under this NOFO are encouraged to propose projects that are part of a comprehensive plan to address housing conditions in their communities, including overcrowding and physically deteriorating units, as appropriate. Applicants should also engage in long-term planning and ensure that the project being proposed is part of a holistic plan that considers planned future infrastructure development, economic development opportunities, and more. All applications received through this NOFO that pass application screening and threshold review will be rated. Funds will be awarded in rank order based on the score received on the application submitted under this NOFO. HUD reserves the right to issue a supplemental or independent NOFO if necessary (e.g., to ensure that all appropriated funds are awarded). Grantees must comply with the requirements of NAHASDA and 24 CFR part 1000. The Office of Native American Programs (ONAP) within HUD&#8217;s Office of Public and Indian Housing will administer this program."
71121,VA-HPGPDP,Homeless Providers Grant and Per Diem Program,HO,"SUMMARY: During the National Emergency due to COVID&#8211;19, VA announces the availability of approximately $75 million in capital grants to increase safety and reduce the risk to Veterans in GPD transitional housing who otherwise would be experiencing homelessness. Funding for grants awarded under this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) is made available through the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARP) (P.L. 117-2). This NOFO responds to the mounting need for equity in communities where evidence suggests that the existing supply of transitional housing is inadequate to meet the demand of unsheltered Veterans. As shown in the 2020 Annual Homelessness Assessment Report released by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in January 2021, although the increase in the number of Veterans experiencing homelessness between 2019 and 2020 was small (i.e. less than 1%), the increase was entirely among Veterans staying in unsheltered places. The funding offered under this NOFO will allow current GPD grantees to improve the transitional housing they offer to Veterans, potentially making transitional housing more attractive than unsheltered places for Veterans who previously were difficult to outreach. By increasing the availability of private accommodations, this funding will provide for the safety of Veterans experiencing homelessness and reduce or avoid the risk associated with shared or congregate accommodations. This is the second batch of funding in a limited series of funding opportunities designed to continue relief efforts in response to COVID-19. While the first batch of funding, made available through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, 2020 (CARES Act) (P.L. 116-136), supported a remarkable 200% more grants than originally forecasted, the funding did not reach all of the communities in need. Therefore, this second opportunity targets other communities in need, such as high-cost areas, by increasing the funding available, by continuing to focus on current GPD grantees and continuing to hold applicants to high standards. VA continues to monitor current events as they impact the transitional housing needed in communities. VA is committed to supporting community-based organizations as they transform programs and meet the challenge of providing high-quality transitional housing to Veterans experiencing homelessness. DATES: Applications for grants must be received by the GPD National Program Office no later than 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time on December 6, 2021. In the interest of fairness to all, this deadline is firm as to date and hour. VA will treat any application received after the deadline as ineligible. Applicants should take this practice into account and submit their materials early to avoid the risk of unanticipated delays, computer service outages or other submission-related problems that might result in ineligibility. APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS: The required documentation for applications is outlined under the Application Documentation Required sections of this NOFO. For detailed GPD program information and requirements, see part 61 of title 38, Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.) or 38 C.F.R. part 61. APPLICATION SUBMISSION: Applications must be submitted by following instructions at www.va.gov/homeless/gpd.asp. Applications may not be submitted any other way. Applications must be received by the GPD National Program Office no later than 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the application deadline date. Applications must be submitted as a complete package. Materials arriving separately will not be included in the application package for consideration and may result in the application being rejected or not funded. I. Funding Opportunity Description A. Purpose The funding offered under this NOFO will allow current GPD grantees to improve the transitional housing they offer to Veterans, potentially making transitional housing more attractive than unsheltered places for Veterans who previously were difficult to outreach. By creating private rooms with private bathrooms, this funding will provide for the personal safety of Veterans experiencing homelessness and reduce or avoid the risk associated with close quarters living. VA is committed to supporting GPD grantees as they continue to transform programs and meet the challenges of providing high-quality transitional housing to Veterans experiencing homelessness. Funding is offered to current GPD grantees only. For purposes of this NOFO, a current GPD grantee is an organization that has an active GPD grant under NOFO VA-GPD-PDO-FY2020, and that is eligible for an option year award starting October 1, 2022. For purposes of this NOFO, a current GPD grantee includes Per Diem Only (PDO) transitional housing projects. For purposes of this NOFO, a current GPD grantee does not include GPD grantees with only a PDO Service Center grant, Transition in Place (TIP) grant, Special Need grant or Case Management grant unless they also have an active PDO transitional housing grant. The purpose of this NOFO is to provide capital grants to support acquisition, construction and/or rehabilitation of real property used for GPD transitional housing facilities. Funds provided through this NOFO are not to support per diem costs, services costs, or the cost of operating transitional housing beds for Veterans. Eligibility is summarized here and also discussed in the Eligibility section of this NOFO: &#183; Applicants, as defined by Employer Identification Number (EIN), are limited to one application per currently active GPD PDO grant per VA medical facility catchment area. &#183; Applications must be from the same organization with the same EIN as is associated with the currently active GPD PDO Federal Award Identifying Number (FAIN). &#183; Organizations who are not currently a GPD grantee with an active PDO grant are not eligible to apply. &#183; Each application must be for the improvement of some or all the GPD beds currently associated with the active GPD PDO grant. Temporary sites (e.g., sites not under the applicant&#8217;s direct ownership or control such as motels being used as a temporary measure during the COVID-19 National Emergency) are not eligible for improvement under this NOFO. See payment details under the Award Administration Information section of the NOFO for site control requirements. &#183; Beds that were selected for funding under GPD&#8217;s previous capital NOFO VA-GPD-CG-FY2021 are not eligible for funding under this NOFO even if the previous funding is declined by the applicant. Only beds that were not part of an application submitted under capital NOFO VA-GPD-CG-FY2021 and not selected for funding under that NOFO are eligible under this NOFO. &#183; Each application may request no more than $75,000 total costs per GPD bed that, upon completion of the project, will be changed from a bed in a shared space to a bed in a private room with a private bathroom. &#183; Each applicant may request no more than $4.5 million total costs per application. &#183; The number of beds proposed to be changed from a bed in a shared space to a bed in a private room with a private bathroom with funds from this capital grant may be less than, but must not exceed, the total number of beds authorized under the GPD PDO grant. NOTE: For grantees with GPD beds in spaces that flex over time, the maximum number of beds proposed to be changed under this capital grant must not exceed the average number of GPD beds documented over the three months prior to the NOFO publication month. &#183; An eligible activity may include adding only private bathrooms to bedrooms that already are single occupancy; however, the need for this activity might rank lower than the need for activity that creates both private bedrooms and private bathrooms. &#183; An activity is not eligible if it is related to capital improvements to a Service Center. Applications that request funding for Service Centers are not eligible. &#183; Upon completion of the project, the GPD beds changed from a bed in a shared space to a bed in a private room with a private bathroom must continue to be in the same VA medical facility catchment area as the active GPD PDO grant. A change in VA medical facility catchment areas is not allowed. Applicants proposing sites that are within the VA medical facility catchment area, but are a significant distance from their current location, must describe in the Abstract section of the application how they will address relevant impacts (e.g., proximity to VA, employment, transportation). Applicants are reminded that they must continue to provide the same level (or better) of staffing and services as described in the fiscal year (FY) 2020 PDO application, or as modified through an approved change of scope. Applicants are encouraged to consider the responsibilities they assume if they are funded and to carefully request only the changes to beds and dollar amounts that correspond to the responsibility, they are willing to assume. Specifically, successful applicants are subject to the recovery provisions of 38 C.F.R. 61.67. VA will seek recovery for awarded capital grant funds on a prorated basis if at any time during the minimum operational period a grantee no longer has an active GPD PDO grant and/or if a grantee does not maintain bed numbers. Grantees who do not maintain occupancy levels are subject to bed reduction. Applicants should become familiar with the amount of time provided for completion of the PDO project under 38 C.F.R. 61.67 in order to avoid capital grant repayments. Operational time for these grants will begin on the activation date (i.e., not the award date, but the date GPD approves activation after project completion; see definition of &#8220;activation date&#8221; later in the NOFO). For details, refer to the table at the end of this NOFO and the regulations. D. Housing Specifications NOTE: This NOFO cannot predict all potential housing arrangements and related circumstances. Applicants are expected to propose plans within the requirements and guidance of the NOFO. When a specific situation is not explicitly addressed in the NOFO, applicants must use their judgment to propose plans that meet the intent of the NOFO and may explain how their choices align with the intent of the program. All applications will be evaluated against the requirements and guidance of the NOFO. 1. Funding must only be used to create private rooms with private bathrooms. Every GPD bed improved with this capital grant must result in a bed changing from being in a shared space to a bed in a private bedroom with a private bathroom for the GPD Veteran upon completion of the project. 2. The inspection standards outlined in title 38 C.F.R. 61.80 must be met, including requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the current edition of the Life Safety Code of the National Fire Protection Association as it relates to the specific facility. Applicants should note that all facilities must be protected throughout by an approved automatic sprinkler system unless a facility is specifically exempt under the Life Safety Code. Applicants must consider this when submitting their applications. 3. Upon completion of the project, the GPD beds improved under this capital grant must be in private rooms including the following characteristics: &#183; The minimum square footage for the private bedroom and private bathroom combined is 120 square feet. The bedroom and bathroom do not need to be attached; in which case the walkway would not usually count toward the square footage calculation. &#183; The bathroom must include shower and/or tub, sink and toilet. &#183; Neither the bedroom nor the bathroom facilities may be shared (e.g., no shared sink area outside the toilet room). &#183; Rooms with partial walls are not acceptable. Walls must go floor-to-ceiling. Rooms must have a door and not involve unauthorized passage through another dwelling unit. 4. After the capital project is completed, if a space will no longer be used for GPD beds, the expectation is that GPD homeless Veterans would not be placed in beds in that space in the future indefinitely unless the space is later improved consistent with (or better than) the standards described in this NOFO. 5. Upon completion of the project, GPD beds in shared spaces must be reduced and GPD beds in private rooms must be increased. Applicants must consider how they will measure these changes to show that spaces are safer and healthier for Veterans. "

71779,HUD,Department of Housing and Urban Development,HO,"The purpose of this assistance is to continue investing in the creation and maintenance of a professional and effective housing counseling industry that is able to meaningfully assist consumers by providing them with the information they need to make informed housing choices and maximizes the impact of Federal funding appropriated for HUD&#8217;s Housing Counseling Program. Statutory requirements enacted as part of the Dodd&#8211;Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) require that individual housing counselors participating in HUD&#8217;s Housing Counseling Program shall demonstrate, by written examination, that they are competent in providing counseling in each of the core topics provided at section 106(e)(2)(12 U.S.C. 1701x(e)(2). HUD published the Final Rule implementing Housing Counseling Certification requirements on December 14, 2016 at 81 FR 90632. A revision of the certification timeline was later published in a Final Rule on December 4, 2020 at 85 FR 78230. The 2016 rule implements statutory requirements that housing counseling required under or provided in connection with all HUD programs must be provided by HUD a HUD-certified counselor employed by a HUD approved or Participating Agency . HUD requires six (6) Core Topics in which housing counselors need to be competent. These are: Financial Management; Property Maintenance; Homeownership and Tenancy; Fair Housing and other Civil Rights Laws and Requirements; Housing Affordability; Avoidance of, and responses to, rental and mortgage delinquency and avoidance of eviction and mortgage default. HUD also acknowledges the need for more housing counselors trained in Rental Housing and Mortgage Delinquency/Default counseling. In that regard, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) enacted on March 27, 2020, as well as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Federal Housing Administration (FHA) , provided various moratoriums on foreclosure and eviction filings to provide urgent economic relief to households impacted by COVID-19. The prospect of these moratoria expiring has amplified the need for more trained counselors. HUD also recognizes the important role housing counselors can provide in helping to mitigate delinquencies and defaults leading to s foreclosures and evictions and how that mitigation can help decrease losses to the FHA Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund. This assistance will expand the number of agencies and counselors who can provide Rental Housing and Mortgage Delinquency/Default counseling. Current HUD priorities also center on Disiaster Preparation and Recovery. Housing counseling agencies (HCA&apos;s) are in a unique position to help their communities prepare for and recover from a disaster. They can help their clients prepare for disasters by integrating preparedness into their counseling and education activities. Post-disaster, they can use their knowledge of local resources and programs to help clients navigate the complexities of disaster recovery resources and programs. This NOFO supports courses that provide training in the areas of disaster preparation and recovery. HUD recognizes that counselors may specialize in specific housing counseling topics, and that counselors will need more than general housing counseling training in order to provide high quality services that include general and specialized housing counseling topics. This NOFO provides notice of a grant program that supports the provision of both basic housing counseling training and specialized topics of training including training in the core topics for housing counselor certification, rental housing counseling, mortgage delinquency/default counseling, and disaster preparation and recovery to help meet these perceived needs. This financial support will assist housing counseling agencies to increase the use of partnerships with local and state-wide organizations to provide additional place-based training on state and local issues. In addition, this support should result in an increased number of training scholarships."

Radon is an odorless, colorless radioactive gas which is a decay product of elements in soil and rock and is present in every part of the country. Low levels of radon are found in the outside air; however, radon gas can move through the soil and enter buildings through small openings in the foundation or basement and become concentrated in the indoor air. When radon is inhaled it releases radiation that can damage lung tissue, and in doing so, increase the risk of developing lung cancer. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that approximately 21,000 people die in the U.S. annually due to lung cancer from radon exposure[1].

73803,CNCS,Corporation for National and Community Service,HO,"A. Purpose of AmeriCorps fundingAmeriCorps grants are awarded to eligible organizations engaged in evidence-based or evidence-informed (e.g. performance data, research, theory of change) interventions that use AmeriCorps members to strengthen communities. An AmeriCorps member is an individual who engages in community service through an approved national service position. Members may receive a living allowance and other benefits while serving. Upon successful completion of their service, members receive a Segal AmeriCorps Education Award from the National Service Trust. For nearly two decades, the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) has invested in community solutions across the nation -- working hand in hand with local partners to improve lives, expand economic opportunity, and engage millions of Americans in solving problems in their communities. With its unique structure as a public-private partnership and its cost-effective model of engaging citizens and leveraging outside resources, national service offers a quadruple bottom line return on investment: benefiting the recipients of service, those who serve, and local communities and our nation.Through all its programs, CNCS expands economic opportunity &#150; helping Americans acquire the skills, education, and training they need for productive employment. By helping more Americans graduate, purse higher education, and find work, national service provides immediate and long term benefits, by expanding individual opportunity, building family stability, and creating more sustainable, resilient communities.Through AmeriCorps and other programs, CNCS brings vital leadership, resources, and coordination to some of the most pressing challenges facing America: educating students for jobs of the 21st century, supporting individuals, families, and neighborhoods on the road to economic recovery; addressing the needs of military families and a new generation of veterans returning from war; helping communities rebuild after natural disasters; strengthening energy efficiency and improving at-risk ecosystems; and providing healthy futures.CNCS believes that all Americans should have opportunities to participate in national service, including those communities that have been traditionally underrepresented in national service, such as rural residents, veterans and military families, Native Americans, and &#147;Opportunity Youth,&#148; the one in six young people (ages 16-24) who are disconnected from school or work. CNCS recognizes that service can create powerful pathways to education and employment for these populations, transforming their communities and creating broad economic benefit for the country. In order to carry out Congress&#146; intent and to maximize the impact of investment in national service, CNCS is targeting AmeriCorps funding in the following focus areas:Disaster Services:Grant activities will:&#149; Increase the preparedness of individuals.&#149; Improve individuals&#146; readiness to respond.&#149; Help individuals recover from disasters.&#149; Help individuals mitigate disasters. Economic Opportunity:Grants will provide support and/or facilitate access to services and resources that contribute to the improved economic well-being and security of economically disadvantaged people. Grant activities will help economically disadvantaged people to:&#149; Have improved access to services and benefits aimed at contributing to their enhanced financial literacy. &#149; Transition into or remain in safe, healthy, affordable housing.&#149; Have improved employability leading to increased success in becoming employed. Education: Grants will provide support and/or facilitate access to services and resources that contribute to improved educational outcomes for economically disadvantaged individuals, especially children. CNCS is particularly interested in program designs that support youth engagement and service-learning as strategies to achieve improved academic outcomes. Grant activities will improve:&#149; School readiness for economically disadvantaged young children.&#149; Educational and behavioral outcomes of students in low-achieving elementary, middle, and high schools.&#149; The preparation for and prospects of success in post-secondary education institutions for economically disadvantaged students. Environmental Stewardship:Grants will provide support for direct services that contribute to increased energy and water efficiency, renewable energy use, or improving at-risk ecosystems. In addition, grants will support increased citizen behavioral change leading to increased efficiency, renewable energy use, and ecosystem improvements particularly for economically disadvantaged households and communities. Grant activities will:&#149; Decrease energy and water consumption.&#149; Improve at-risk ecosystems.&#149; Increase behavioral changes that lead directly to decreased energy and water consumption or improved at-risk ecosystems.&#149; Increase green training opportunities that may lead to decreased energy and water consumption or improved at-risk ecosystems.In addition, the Administration is exploring ways to provide service, training, education, and employment opportunities for young Americans through protecting, restoring and enhancing public and tribal lands. CNCS is exploring potential programs along the lines of a &#147;21st century Civilian Service Corps&#148; that can facilitate conservation service work on public lands and encourage a new generation of natural resource managers and environmental scientists, particularly in low income and disadvantaged communities. Healthy Futures:Grants will meet health needs within communities including access to care, aging in place, and childhood obesity. Grant activities will:&#149; Improve access to primary and preventive health care for communities served by CNCS-supported programs.&#149; Increase seniors&#146; ability to remain in their own homes with the same or improved quality of life for as long as possible. &#149; Increase physical activity and improve nutrition in youth with the purpose of reducing childhood obesity.Veterans and Military Families:Grants will positively impact the quality of life of veterans and improve military family strength. Grant activities will increase:&#149; The number of veterans and military service members and their families served by CNCS-supported programs.&#149; The number of veterans and military family members engaged in service through CNCS-supported programs. Capacity Building:In addition to the six focus areas described above, grants also will provide support for capacity building activities provided by national service participants. As a general rule, CNCS considers capacity building activities to be indirect services that enable CNCS-supported organizations to provide more, better, and sustained direct services in CNCS&#146; six focus areas. Capacity building activities cannot be solely intended to support the administration or operations of the organization. Examples of capacity building activities include:&#149; Recruiting and/or managing community volunteers.&#149; Implementing effective volunteer management practices.&#149; Completing community assessments that identify goals and recommendations.&#149; Developing new systems and business processes (technology, performance management, training, etc.) or enhancing existing systems and business processes.Encore Programs:Congress set a goal that 10 percent of AmeriCorps funding should support encore service programs that engage a significant number of participants age 55 or older. CNCS seeks to meet that 10 percent target in this competition and encourages encore programs to apply. National Performance Measures:The SAA emphasizes measuring the impact of service and focusing on a core set of issue areas. CNCS&#146; five-year Strategic Plan establishes an ambitious set of objectives that support the mission and goals to implement the SAA. These strategic goals guided the development of sixteen agency-wide Priority Measures. National Performance Measures allow CNCS to demonstrate aggregated impact of all its national service programs, including AmeriCorps State and National. They are divided in two categories: Priority Measures and Complementary Program Measures. For more information, please refer to the National Performance Measure Instructions.B. 2013 AmeriCorps Funding Priorities In the FY 2013 AmeriCorps competition, CNCS seeks to prioritize the investment of national service resources in economic opportunity, education, veterans and military families, disaster services, and the Governor and Mayor Initiative (described more fully below). CNCS will continue to focus on national service programs that improve academic outcomes for children, youth, and young adults. This focus reflects the extensive experience and past success of national service programs in education, and aligns with the efforts of the Department of Education. In addition, CNCS seeks to increase its investment in programs that serve veterans and military families or engage veterans and military families in service. CNCS will also focus investment in programs that increase community resiliency through disaster preparation, response, recovery, and mitigation.CNCS will focus investment in programs that increase economic opportunities for community and AmeriCorps members.Applicants proposing programs that receive priority consideration are not guaranteed funding. CNCS will seek to build a diversified portfolio across the focus areas, and other considerations outlined below in Section V. B. Furthermore, programs must demonstrate significant program focus, design, and impact to receive priority consideration. CNCS will give priority consideration to applicants in the following Tiers, in descending order of preference:Tier 1: Programs that select:&#149; Complementary Program Measures in Economic Opportunity (Programs that select O12, O14, O15, O17 must also select an additional Priority or Complementary Program Measure from Tier 1, 2, or 3 that measures community impact), or&#149; Priority Measures in Education and serve in schools that received awards under the School Improvement Grants (SIG) program and are implementing one of the SIG school intervention models and/or Priority Schools identified by a State educational agency (SEA) that has received approval from the Department of Education of its request for Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) flexibility, or &#149; Priority Measures in Veterans and Military Families, or &#149; Priority Measures in Disaster Services, or&#149; Governor and Mayor Initiative. NOTE: Programs that fit these Priority or Complementary Program Measures are required to use these measures. These measures can be found in Section IX, Tier 1. Applicants whose members will be serving in schools that received awards under the School Improvement Grants (SIG) program and are implementing one of the SIG school intervention models and/or Priority Schools identified by a State educational agency (SEA) that has received approval from the Department of Education of its request for Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) flexibility must check the box on the Performance Measure tab in eGrants &#147;SIG/Priority Schools&#148; to be considered for Tier 1. The &#147;NCES School ID&#148; will need to be entered in the service location information at the time the members are enrolled. Tier 2: Programs that select Priority Measures in:&#149; Education that are not serving in schools that received awards under the School Improvement Grants (SIG) program and are implementing one of the SIG school intervention models and/or Priority Schools identified by a State educational agency (SEA) that has received approval from the Department of Education of its request for Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) flexibility, or&#149; Environmental Stewardship, or&#149; Healthy Futures, or &#149; Capacity Building. NOTE: Programs that fit these Priority Measures are required to use these measures. These measures can be found in Section IX, Tier 2.Tier 3: Programs that select Complementary Program Measures. These measures can be found in Section IX. Tier 3. Tier 4: Programs in the Focus Areas with self-nominated measures.Tier 5: Programs outside the Focus Areas with self-nominated measures. Continuation requests for expansion will receive priority consideration and preference in the same manner as described above.Governor and Mayor Initiative:CNCS will be piloting the Governor and Mayor Initiative and it will be given priority consideration in Tier 1. CNCS sets as a goal that 10% of the available funds for this year&#146;s grant competition will support this initiative.CNCS will accept one application per state. The application must address a pressing challenge the Governor wishes to solve in her or his state. A Governor must apply with one Mayor in his or her state and a minimum of two nonprofits. In conjunction with the Mayor, the Governor will be responsible for identifying and selecting those nonprofits that are best able to achieve a demonstrated positive impact on the problem. The application should include letters of commitment from selected partnering nonprofit entities, or describe the process that the Governor and Mayor will use to select the nonprofit entities. The application, submitted to the State Commission, will respond to the application criteria and explain how several nonprofits working together, with the Governor&#146;s office serving as a convener, will effectively deploy AmeriCorps members for a collective impact. For example, a Governor and a Mayor in her state could conclude the most pressing challenge facing the state is its high school graduation rate. Together, they could decide to focus on the elementary, junior high, and senior high schools in the Mayor&#146;s town. The Governor and/or Mayor would submit one application describing:&#149; How the partnership will be organized and AmeriCorps resources will be allocated between the partnering entities (State, locality, and nonprofit entities).&#149; The proposed theory of change and program model. If the program model has not yet been fully developed, this should outline the approach that the consortium will take to ensure that implementation can begin within 90 days of grant award.&#149; How they will utilize an identified consortium of four nonprofits that are well positioned to impact outcomes for those three schools using their theory of change. For example, nonprofit A operates an AmeriCorps program whose members are focused on increasing literacy gains. Nonprofit B operates an AmeriCorps program whose members are focused on school readiness. Nonprofit C operates an AmeriCorps program whose members are focused on increased food security. Nonprofit D operates an AmeriCorps program whose members recruit community volunteers. In geographic locations where other city, state, and place-based initiatives are under way, CNCS encourages Governors and Mayors to partner with these public/private partnerships supported by non-profits, faith-based and community organizations, the private sector, local and state elected leadership, as well as city or neighborhood focused federal initiatives. Programs that operate in the summer and engage middle school youth in building skills would be an appropriate program design for this Initiative. Applications submitted as part of the Governor and Mayor Initiative must check the &#147;Governor and Mayor Initiative&#148; box in the Performance Measure tab and email a letter of endorsement cosigned by the Governor and Mayor, as well as signed letters of commitment from partnering nonprofits to americorpsgrants@cns.gov in order to be considered for this Initiative. The subject line of the email must include [Your State] Governor and Mayor Initiative.Note: Only the Governor, Mayor, or their designated government office may apply for grants under the Governor and Mayor initiative. Applications from other entities will be deemed unresponsive."

75937,HUD,Department of Housing and Urban Development,HO,"This NOFO supports qualitative research focused on the Moving to Work (MTW) Stepped and Tiered Rent Demonstration (STRD). In the Stepped and Tiered Rent Demonstration (STRD), ten public housing agencies (PHAs) will implement alternative rents that might be easier to administer and might incentivize assisted households to increase their earnings. The traditional rent policy applied by PHAs (referred to as the Brooke rent) typically sets an assisted household&#8217;s rent at 30 percent of their adjusted monthly income. This rent policy is administratively complex and burdensome for both PHAs and assisted households. The Brooke rent is hypothesized to be a disincentive for households to increase their earnings, as $100 dollars of increased income would result in $30 of increased rent. Under the STRD, five PHAs will implement a stepped rent, under which a household&#8217;s rent will increase modestly each year regardless of their income, and five PHAs will implement a tiered rent, under which households are assigned to income-based tiers and rents are set based on the tier. The STRD is designed as an experiment, and HUD is already funding an independent impact evaluation (find the research design, data collection and analysis plan at the following link: https://www.huduser.gov/portal/mtw/cohort2.html). The objective of this NOFO, the Qualitative Data Collection for Cohort 2 MTW Expansion- Rent Reform Experiment, is to support qualitative research focused on the assisted households served by the ten PHAs that are participating in the STRD. The objective of the qualitative data collection to be supported under this NOFO is to gather information that documents how low-income renters make sense of and respond to different rent policies. Research conducted under these grants is expected to complement HUD&apos;s ongoing STRD impact evaluation by providing rich qualitative information related to the implementation of the new stepped and tiered rent policies, with a particular emphasis on how the rent policies are experienced by assisted housheolds participating in the demonstration.

The COE will perform academic research, hold expert convenings, and conduct related activities designed to advance understanding of economic and social factors that affect communities, including housing, economic and workforce development, health and health care, education, civic engagement, public safety, and other dimensions of community health. Through academic programs, research projects and thought leadership, the COE will help leaders across all levels of government, as well as the business and civic sectors, address critical issues that impact the social and economic well-being of the families and individuals who reside in underserved communities.This program intends to fund a series of research reports that will apply new and context-specific approaches and methods to studying challenges faced by urban and rural communities. The findings of these reports will impact policy relevant research at HUD. The Department seeks HSIs with demonstrated capacity to conduct complex research and devise actionable policy recommendations. At the same time, HUD encourages applicants to propose building on their demonstrated experience to do something new and innovative. HUD encourages the submission of proposals that draw on novel research approaches, including big data analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence; community-engaged and participatory research; and novel partnerships such as academic consortia, and collaboration with private entities or other federal agencies. Competitive applications will include action and sustainability plans, creative partnerships and collaboration models, multidisciplinary and holistic methodologies, and new or enhanced theory of change models designed to achieve transformative outcomes.The funds made available under this NOFO will make awards for recipients to undertake multiple research projects. This opportunity will allow the COE(s) to use this work to leverage other streams of revenue, including from private enterprise and private philanthropic organizations, to support ongoing and sustainable operations and activities.As noted in the Presidential Executive Order 13985 on Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government, HUD is particularly interested in research to better understand the disparities in our laws and public policies, and in our public and private institutions, that may deny equal housing and community building opportunities to individuals in underserved communities. HUD seeks policy prescriptions that might address these disparities, the results of which would widely be available for application in the field. As such, proposals should address barriers to improving the quality of life and creating a pathway to economic success in underserved communities. The research should take the view of both short- and long-term strategies. Research must be framed toward a long-term goal (e.g., improving minority homeownership). "

81702,HUD,Department of Housing and Urban Development,HO,"The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARP) recognizes that fair housing enforcement and education and outreach services are essential components of protecting persons from housing discrimination in the United States. The ARP appropriated $20 million in supplemental Fair Housing Initiatives Program funding to HUD to provide emergency relief to Qualified Fair Housing Enforcement Organizations (QFHOs) and Fair Housing Enforcement Organizations (FHOs), public or private not-for-profit organizations or institutions, and other public or private entities that are formulating or carrying out programs to prevent or eliminate discriminatory housing practices; agencies of State or local governments; and agencies that participate in the Fair Housing Assistance Program (FHAP). This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) will provide funding to address fair housing education and outreach services, and the costs of delivering or adapting these services, during or relating to the coronavirus pandemic. In keeping with Congress&#8217;s intent in enacting the American Rescue Plan, applicants may propose new fair housing education and outreach projects relating to discrimination arising in connection with the pandemic or focus on sustaining core fair housing education activities.The ARP Fair Housing Initiatives Program-Education and Outreach Initiative (EOI) NOFO invites applications from eligible EOI organizations seeking support for fair housing activities that are connected to or adversely impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. Through this fourth-round funding opportunity, HUD will award grants to eligible organizations to help them continue to advance their mission during the interruption of their operation and recovery efforts resulting from the coronavirus pandemic. (See Section III. Eligibility Information). As of March 2022, approximately $16.1 million in ARP FHIP funding was awarded, ensuring that much-needed relief was received by victims of housing discrimination within months of enactment of the ARP; the current ARP NOFO provides additional funding for eligible organizations to continue fair housing activities connected to or adversely impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.ARP National Media Campaign Component This NOFO will make available $1 million for a National Media Campaign. The focus of this national media campaign is to address coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic/post-pandemic housing discrimination issues, especially in underserved communities: populations sharing a particular characteristic, as well as geographic communities, that have been systematically denied a full opportunity to participate in aspects of economic, social, and civic life, including Black, Latino, Indigenous, Native American, Asian, Pacific Islander, and other, persons of color; members of religious groups; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) persons; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality; as well as persons with limited English proficiency and other groups of federally protected class members experiencing housing discrimination who have been hit hardest during or relating to the coronavirus pandemic. The campaign must ensure that those most impacted by housing related issues resulting from the pandemic are provided with educational and other resources to identify and combat housing discrimination. The campaign should also focus on areas hit hardest by discriminatory foreclosures and evictions, people experiencing or on the verge of housing instability or homelessness, including those that may face possible displacement due to the end of the foreclosure and eviction moratoriums, senior citizens and people with disabilities who are trying to escape the heightened risk of coronavirus associated with institutional or congregate settings.Studies show that evictions disproportionately affect women of color, with landlords filing for eviction against Black and Hispanic women at higher rates than as against men and white women. The grantee&#8217;s objective will be to create and disseminate fair housing education and outreach materials in areas most significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in highly segregated areas, rural areas and areas with high incidences of discriminatory foreclosure and eviction. During this national emergency, HUD wants to remind housing providers and the public of important federal fair housing laws that protect persons from discrimination, including harassment and intimidation, in housing and related services on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex including sexual orientation and gender identity, familial status and disability. HUD recognizes that persons with disabilities, including those who are older and have underlying medical conditions, are vulnerable and may be at high risk for a severe, life-threatening response to COVID-19; therefore, these persons may face unique fair housing and civil rights issues that need to be addressed. The campaign will provide information for all protected classes on how to file a housing discrimination complaint through HUD or a local fair housing agency. ARP EOI Regional/Local/General Component The purpose of this funding component is to prevent, mitigate, and respond to the effects of COVID-19 and to enhance fair housing education and outreach services and related infrastructure. Consistent with this purpose, funding may support a wide range of in-scope education and outreach activities, which may change as COVID-19 circumstances and related community, public, and organizational needs evolve over the 12 to18 month period of performance. This ARP EOI NOFO makes available $2,385,353.12 million to support eligible organizations and activities. The ARP EOI NOFO provides broad flexibility to each applicant to address specific fair housing education and outreach needs in their communities related to COVID-19. Below are examples of eligible activities and allowable use of funds under this NOFO:Develop and disseminate fair housing education and outreach materials designed to inform members of the public of their rights under the Fair Housing Act and how they can file a housing discrimination complaint. Applicants should focus their efforts on those geographic areas that have been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and should educate the public about the warning signs of discriminatory foreclosures and evictions related to the pandemic, and the remedies available. Applicants may also utilize funding for adaptive services and technology to provide outreach to the public when in-person services are not available due to the rise in coronavirus cases. Rehire fair housing staff laid off as a result of the pandemic and promote workforce development. Establish, expand, sustain and develop fair housing staff to carry out fair housing education and outreach services.Develop, implement and sustain infrastructure projects to promote efficiency and to avert disruptive and costly delays in provision of fair housing services caused by COVID-19.Engage in and implement activities that invest in equity and fair housing opportunities for underserved communities who need the services the most: populations sharing a particular characteristic, as well as geographic communities, that have been systematically denied a full opportunity to participate in aspects of economic, social, and civic life, including Black, Latino, Indigenous, Native American, Asian, Pacific Islander, and other, persons of color; members of religious groups; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer, (LGBTQ+) persons; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality; including young adults.Work to close housing disparities and increase access to affordable housing by educating the public, address sexual harassment prevention, and engage in community-based fair housing crisis intervention.Develop, implement and provide fair housing technical assistance, fair housing staff training and new fair housing curricula.

All of the investments under the GRRP will be made in affordable housing communities serving low-income families in alignment with the Administration&#8217;s Justice 40 goals.HUD is offering GRRP funding through three separate cohorts designed to meet the different needs of HUD&#8217;s assisted multifamily portfolio. Round One of the GRRP consists of three cohorts of awards, implemented through three parallel Notices of Funding Opportunity (NOFOs):The Elements NOFO provides modest awards designed to add proven and highly impactful climate resilience and carbon reduction measures to the construction scopes of in-progress recapitalization transactions.The Leading Edge NOFO provides funding to Owners aiming to quickly meet ambitious carbon reduction and resilience goals without requiring extensive collaboration with HUD.The Comprehensive NOFO provides funding to initiate recapitalization investments designed from inception around deep retrofits, focused on innovative energy efficiency and greening measures, renewable energy generation, use of structural building materials with lower embodied carbon, and climate resilience investments. Comprehensive Awards are designed for the widest range of properties, including those that have not yet developed a recapitalization plan.To the greatest extent feasible, these approaches will:Substantially improve energy and water efficiency, including moving properties toward net zero, zero energy ready, or zero over time energy performance; /Address climate resilience, including synergies that can be achieved between efficiency and resilience investments;Enhance indoor air quality and resident health;Implement the use of zero-emission electricity generation and energy storage;Minimize embodied carbon and incorporate low-emission building materials or processes; andSupport building electrification."

83162,HUD,Department of Housing and Urban Development,HO,"Through this NOFO, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is announcing the availability of $1,000,000 for the research project titled &#8220;Closing the Homeownership Gap and Preserving Homeownership During Economic Decline.&#8221; HUD may fund more than one award from the funds available under this NOFO. The objective of the NOFO is to fund rigorous evaluations of (a) the factors that contribute to the gaps in homeownership rates among different demographic groups, and the effect of public policies and other initiatives (including private or philanthropic efforts) on addressing these gaps, and (b) how homeownership can be preserved during economic decline including the effects of related public policies and other initiatives (including private or philanthropic efforts on achieving preservation goals). Proposals may address either or both these topics. The research funded under this NOFO will advance scientific knowledge and produce policy-relevant evidence on homeownership gaps and may inform the development of future approaches to help communities of color and other underserved communities achieve more equitable homeownership rates. BackgroundHomeownership is often viewed as the entry to the American dream and the gateway to intergenerational wealth. However, this pathway is often less achievable for underserved groups who post a lower homeownership rate than non-underserved families (Ray, et al. 2021). These homeownership gaps have contributed to lower median family wealth for disadvantaged groups. Because wealth (as measured by the total amount of assets a person owns minus debts) is a critical predictor of education, health, employment, and other quality of life metrics, a strategy to address the homeownership gap can have positive effects beyond just housing itself.This NOFO is focused on providing greater analysis and research on critical aspects of the homeownership gap, including residential patterns of undeserved groups/communities and the causes of ethnic/racial/gender/age/other disparities and obstacles to homeownership among these groups. The neighborhoods where homebuyers purchase their homes contribute to their home&#8217;s worth and its chance of appreciation over time, which has important implications for the long-term financial returns associated with homeownership. Despite some progress in achieving integration, weaknesses in fair housing enforcement have undermined the ability of the Fair Housing Act to dismantle segregation and combat discrimination. The forms of discrimination that were common in the past such as segregation by design or edict, including redlining, have shifted over time, and housing discrimination&#8212;along with persisting residential segregation&#8212;continue to hamper disadvantaged homebuyers&#8217; ability to build equity. Home mortgage borrowers in underserved groups and communities remain concentrated in residentially segregated areas where homes have failed to appreciate at the same pace as those in neighborhoods where non-disadvantaged borrowers predominantly buy their homes.A common measure of the extent to which disadvantaged residents are segregated from other groups in cities is the index of dissimilarity. The dissimilarity index represents the percentage of one of the two groups included in the analysis that would have to move in order to achieve more equitable distribution within smaller geographic units that match the composition of the entire city. Minority residents are extremely segregated from the rest of the population in many major cities, e.g., Detroit, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Atlanta. In Atlanta, the city with the highest levels of segregation, almost 70% of minority residents would have to move to new Census tracts to produce a uniform geographic distribution.Racial economic inequality in the United States is primarily the result of unequal investments among communities. Estimates showing the percentage of unbanked or underbanked populations in the U.S. for different racial and ethnic groups often highlight inequalities in the financial health of their neighborhoods (FDIC, 2021). The percentage of blacks (46%) who are unbanked or underbanked alone is over three times the percentage of whites (14%) who experience the same struggle. Thirty-two percent of Hispanics are also either un- or under- banked.This overview provides a general overall look at the role of segregation, discrimination, and racism in the housing market, as well as the consequences for educational attainment and wealth accumulation for persons of color and others in underserved communities, and points to the need for further research and assessment of potential policy responses. Research Objectives and PrioritiesThe objective of this NOFO is to fund research projects that can assess the extent of the homeownership gaps between minorities and majority homeowners; to evaluate the barriers to homeownership facing minorities; and to assess the threats that economic decline pose for homeownership preservation, including public and private responses to these threats. Research could include renters seeking or considering homeownership, new homebuyers, or existing homeowners. Barriers can include mortgage lending discrimination by lenders, disparate outcomes from lending to different applicant demographic groups as well as credit history and collateral requirements that can disadvantage nonwhite applicants. Furthermore, many minority renters could be homeowners if they were not facing financial and discriminatory barriers to acquiring a home. Closing the homeownership gaps requires identifying the factors that prevent renters of color and others in underserved groups from becoming homeowners.The study may be longitudinal or a cross-sectional at borrower level. It could also focus on specific areas or cities where the problem is especially acute or localities that have taken steps toward ameliorating the homeownership gap. Evaluating the effect of various policies and programs, local or national, public or private in addressing the issue is an important topic for this NOFO.The emphasis would be on a quantitative study, but a qualitative approach could be a useful supplement. Data could be loan- or home-level as well as locality-level. Multiple sources of data could be employed. Additional Research ConsiderationsHUD intends to fund proposals that use rigorous methods to measure the extent, causes, and impact of homeownership gaps and explore the effect of economic decline on homeownership preservation. The proposal should discuss how the applicants plan to control other factors that affect homeownership rates, such as federal and local regulations, access to financing and policies, and familiarity of customers with mortgage shopping and other aspects of home acquisition. The proposal may need to identify a plan to control applicant bias (self-selection), regional housing costs, and household demographics. Proposals can be limited to a set of jurisdictions, but the applicant must demonstrate that the proposed jurisdictions are sufficient for a robust analysis, with sufficient data points to allow for robust statistical power, and for the establishment of a counterfactual. The study should describe the method and design specification for estimating the relevant counterfactual outcomes. Applicants are expected to demonstrate that they have or will likely have access to homeownership rates data and other relevant data points included in the study. Applicants should discuss their experience using the proposed data and matching it to other data sources. Applicants should discuss any additional data sources that will be included in the study and the feasibility of obtaining the data. Applicants shall identify major methodological issues and data limitations and ways the study will address them.HUD will not prescribe specific information collection approaches, protocols, or instruments. Any information collection efforts conducted by a grantee to address the NOFO objectives will not be subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act.Eligible ActivitiesEligible activities include all research and project management activities that contribute to meeting the NOFO objectives and research needs at a high-quality level, and specifically to complete the funded research.

83278,HUD,Department of Housing and Urban Development,HO,"The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022 ((Pub. L., 117-103, approved March 15, 2022) (2022 Appropriations Act), made available $25,000,000 for mobility-related services (as defined by the Secretary) for voucher families with children modeled after services provided in connection with the mobility demonstration authorized under section 235 of division G of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 (42 U.S.C. 1437f note; Public Law 116&#8211;6). The overall purpose of these mobility-related services funds made available under the FY 2022 appropriations bill is to expand housing choices for Housing Choice Voucher families with children particularly by increasing access to opportunity neighborhoods with high-performing schools, access to jobs, low crime, parks and other amenities.The HCV program offers families with vouchers the opportunity to live in a neighborhood of their choice, including low-poverty, opportunity neighborhoods. Yet, HCV families may encounter barriers to using their vouchers in communities with expanded opportunities. Some barriers may be financial, such as saving enough money for a security deposit or maintaining a positive credit score. Other barriers may include inadequate time to find a unit, landlord unwillingness to rent to voucher holders, or limited awareness of neighborhood amenities, such as the location of high-performing schools.Congress previously made available $50 million for the Community Choice Demonstration (CCD), formerly known as the HCV mobility demonstration. The CCD is now underway at 8 Public Housing Agency (PHA) sites across the country. As required by the 2022 Appropriations Act, the funds awarded under this NOFO will be modeled after the services provided in the CCD.The CCD builds upon recent research that shows growing up in neighborhoods with lower levels of poverty improves children&apos;s academic achievement and long-term chances of success and reduces intergenerational poverty. Children who move to low-poverty neighborhoods have also been shown to experience lower rates of hospitalizations, lower hospital spending, and some positive changes in mental health over the long-term. Adults given the chance to move to low-poverty neighborhoods experience reductions in obesity and diabetes.The CCD supports selected PHAs in addressing barriers to accessing housing choices by offering mobility-related services to increase the number of voucher families with children living in opportunity areas. The CCD includes a rigorous, independent evaluation to determine what services are most effective at helping families move to opportunity areas. HUD also intends to make materials developed for the Demonstration available to all PHAs for use in their own communities.Under the CCD program, PHAs must offer comprehensive mobility-related services (CMRS), which includes pre- and post-move supports, family financial assistance (e.g. security deposits), landlord outreach, and housing search assistance.The mobility-related services funds made available under this NOFO will allow more PHAs to begin planning for, and implementing housing mobility programs, thus increasing the number of HCV families with children residing in lower-poverty neighborhoods. HUD will continue, to the extent possible, to share lessons learned and evidence from the CCD with grantees to implement successful evidence and practice-based programs. "
83285,HUD,Department of Housing and Urban Development,HO,"Funding provided by this NOFA is intended to support HUD-approved counseling agencies to respond flexibly to the needs of residents and neighborhoods, and deliver a wide variety of housing counseling services to homebuyers, homeowners, renters, and the homeless. This NOFA comes at a critical time when many Americans are facing the economic challenges associated with loss of employment, reducing debt and reestablishing credit history, the housing challenges associated with natural disasters, the transition from ownership to rental and the need for improved housing conditions. Traditionally underserved populations, such as minorities, the elderly, veterans, persons with disabilities, and residents of rural areas, face additional housing and economic challenges. HUD&#146;s Comprehensive Housing Counseling Grant Program funds housing counselors who provide expert, unbiased guidance and information to help families and individuals meet their housing needs and improve their financial situations.

84979,HUD,Department of Housing and Urban Development,HO,"FHEO has determined that fair housing testing technical assistance is critical to the Department&#239;&#191;&#189;s Fair Housing Initiative Program&#239;&#191;&#189;s enforcement effort. Fair housing testing is a vital tool for determining the extent of housing discrimination and is an effective component of a well-investigated complaint. Good testing results can speed up the investigation of complaints and provide a sound basis for documenting discriminatory practices. The Department has recognized the benefits of testing through our FHIP organizations. Additionally, many FHIP organizations have not been provided technical assistance on identifying the best complaints for testing nor on analyzing testing results for their most effective use. By taking the lead in establishing levels of high quality and consistency in testing protocols, the Department can set the standard in testing activities and ensure that the FHIP testing results are beneficial to on-going investigations. To address these issues, this funding will provide training and technical assistance to one or more entities by developing a course on Fair Housing Testing, and by conducting technical assistance to promote a greater and more consistent use of Testing Methodologies among FHIP organizations. Testing represents the most effective investigative tool in uncovering and corroborating claims of unlawful discrimination. Improving the quality and consistency of testing used by FHIP organizations will increase the persuasiveness and acceptance of tests in litigation. This is designed to provide FHIP organizations with the necessary tools to conduct, understand, and analyze testing with the stated goal of contributing to the Department&#239;&#191;&#189;s enforcement efforts."

85169,HUD,Department of Housing and Urban Development,HO,"Communities nationwide are suffering from a lack of affordable housing, and housing production is not meeting the increasing demand for accessible and available units in many urban and rural areas, particularly areas of high opportunity. Pathways to Removing Obstacles to Housing (PRO Housing) empowers communities that are actively taking steps to remove barriers to affordable housing and seeking to increase housing production and lower housing costs for families over the long term.Barriers to affordable housing can be caused by zoning decisions, land use policies, or regulations; inefficient procedures; gaps in available resources for development; deteriorating or inadequate infrastructure; lack of neighborhood amenities; or challenges to preserving existing housing stock such as increasing threats from natural hazards, redevelopment that reduces the number of affordable units, or expiration of affordability requirements.Across the United States, regulatory and other barriers have made it difficult to produce, preserve, and access affordable housing. Constrained supply drives up housing costs and this reduces affordability over the long term. According to American Community Survey estimates in 2021, 39.3 million households (20.9 million renters and 18.4 million homeowners) have been classified as &#8220;cost-burdened,&#8221; spending more than 30 percent of their income on housing. When broken down by race, Black families face affordability challenges as homeowners and renters more than any other race/ethnic group, spending between 30 to 50 percent of their income on housing. In Puerto Rico, cost-burdened households face severe affordability challenges, spending between 50 to 90 percent of their income on housing. Limited access to housing has long-term effects on access to opportunity and ability to build generational wealth, especially for underserved communities of color and low-income people. Affordability challenges and the lack of affordable housing supply further increase eviction pressures and likelihood of homelessness for low-income people.HUD is issuing this NOFO under the authority of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 (Public Law 117-328, approved December 29, 2022) (Appropriations Act), which appropriates $85 million for competitive grant funding for the identification and removal of barriers to affordable housing production and preservation. Congress has directed HUD to undertake a competition using the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) statutory and regulatory framework. Under this NOFO, HUD will provide PRO Housing grants to identify and remove barriers to affordable housing production and preservation. Grantees may use awards to further develop, evaluate, and implement housing policy plans, improve housing strategies, and facilitate affordable housing production and preservation. Eligible applicants are local and state governments, metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs), and multijurisdictional entities.HUD has six goals for this competition:Fairly and effectively award the PRO Housing grant fundingElevate and enable promising practices dedicated to identifying and removing barriers to affordable housing production and preservation, while preventing displacementInstitutionalize state and local analysis and implementation of effective, equitable, and resilient approaches to affordable housing production and preservationProvide technical assistance to help communities better fulfill the Consolidated Plan&#8217;s requirement of identifying barriers to affordable housing and implementing solutions to address those barriersAffirmatively further fair housing by addressing and removing barriers that perpetuate segregation, barriers that inhibit access to well-resourced areas of opportunity for protected class groups and vulnerable populations, and barriers that concentrate affordable housing in under-resourced areas.Facilitate collaboration and harness innovative approaches from jurisdictions, researchers, advocates, and stakeholders.HUD will prioritize applicants that demonstrate: (1) progress and a commitment to overcoming local barriers to facilitate the increase in affordable housing production and preservation; and (2) an acute demand for housing affordable to households with incomes below 100 percent of the area median income. If applicable, proposals should also explain how the funds would be used to identify and remove barriers to affordable housing in a manner that affirmatively furthers fair housing by expanding access to housing opportunities in well-resourced areas for protected class groups. HUD will also prioritize applicants that demonstrate a commitment and ability to identify and remove barriers to (1) expanding affordable housing in a manner that would promote desegregation; (2) expanding affordable housing in well-resourced areas of opportunity for protected class groups that have systematically been denied equitable access to such areas; or (3) deconcentrating affordable housing and increasing housing choice. HUD encourages applications that incorporate a discussion of key barriers related to land-use regulations, permitting, or related procedural issues. HUD further encourages applicants to outline and discuss how their proposed activities will advance equity, locate affordable accessible housing near transit and bolster access to services and opportunities, increase community resilience and mitigate the effects of natural and environmental hazards, and develop and preserve affordable housing in accordance with input from community members and other stakeholders.As with all CDBG assistance, the priority is to serve low- and moderate-income people.PRO Housing grantees must administer the PRO Housing grant in a manner that affirmatively furthers fair housing, which means taking meaningful actions, in addition to combating discrimination, to overcome patterns of segregation and foster inclusive communities free from barriers that restrict access to opportunity based on protected characteristics. Specifically, affirmatively furthering fair housing means taking meaningful actions that, taken together, address significant disparities in housing needs and in access to opportunities, replacing segregated living patterns with truly integrated and balanced living patterns, transforming racially and ethnically concentrated areas of poverty into areas of opportunity, and fostering and maintaining compliance with civil rights and fair housing laws."
85279,HUD,Department of Housing and Urban Development,HO,"1. PurposeThe Healthy Homes Production Program (HHP) is part of HUD&#8217;s overall Healthy Homes Initiative launched in 1999. The program takes a comprehensive approach to addressing multiple childhood diseases and injuries in the home by focusing on housing-related hazards in a coordinated fashion, rather than addressing a single hazard at a time. The program builds upon HUD&#8217;s successful Lead Hazard Control programs to expand the Department&#8217;s efforts to address a variety of high-priority environmental health and safety hazards. Applicants receiving a Healthy Homes Production Award will be expected to accomplish the following objectives:Maximize both the number of vulnerable residents protected from housing-related environmental health and safety hazards and the number of housing units where these hazards are controlled;Identify and remediate housing-related health and safety hazards in privately owned, low-income rental and/or owner-occupied housing, especially in units and/or buildings where families with children, older adults 62 years and older, or families with persons with disabilities reside;Promote cost-effective and efficient healthy home methods and approaches that can be replicated and sustained;Support public education and outreach that furthers the goal of protecting children and other vulnerable populations from housing-related health and safety hazards;Build local capacity to operate sustainable programs that will prevent and control housing-related environmental health and safety hazards in low- and very low-income residences, and develop a professional workforce that is trained in healthy homes assessment and principles;Promote integration of this grant program with housing rehabilitation, property maintenance, weatherization, healthy homes initiatives, local lead-based paint hazard control programs, health and safety programs, and energy efficiency improvement activities and programs;Build and enhance partner resources to develop the most cost-effective methods for identifying and controlling key housing-related environmental health and safety hazards;Promote collaboration, data sharing, and targeting between health and housing departments;Ensure to the greatest extent feasible that job training, employment, contracting, and other economic opportunities generated by this grant will be directed to low- and very-low-income persons, particularly those who are recipients of government assistance for housing, and to businesses that provide economic opportunities to low- and very low-income persons in the area in which the project is located. For more information, see 24 CFR 135 (Section 3);Further environmental justice, the fair treatment, and meaningful involvement of all people within the target communities regardless of race, color, national origin, disability, religion, sex (including sexual orientation and gender identify), familial status or income regarding the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies; k.

In 1999, the United States Supreme Court issued the landmark decision in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), affirming that the unjustified segregation of individuals with disabilities is a form of discrimination prohibited by Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Olmstead held that persons with disabilities must have choice in the housing, health care, and related support services they receive. As individual states facilitate the transition and integration of persons with disabilities at serious risk of institutionalization and other segregated settings into the community, Sponsors/Owners of supportive rental housing for persons with disabilities have an opportunity to design innovative approaches to meet the associated challenges and opportunities. HUD is committed to helping offer very low-income persons with disabilities housing options that provide meaningful choices about housing, health care, and long-term services and support, so they can participate fully in community life. The Frank Melville Supportive Housing Investment Act of 2010 (Pub. L. No. 111-374) amended Section 811 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 8013), including the PRAC program, to better achieve this goal.HUD through this NOFO seeks to fund innovative Section 811 permanent supportive housing models that will be at the forefront of design, service delivery and efficient use of federal resources. To meet this goal, HUD expects successful applications to demonstrate best practices or innovation in both physical design and supportive services. Proposals must promote the long-term housing security and facilitate community integration of persons with disabilities. HUD aims to provide Capital Advance funding to those applicants who meet the goal of developing permanent supportive housing. For more information about specific Review Criteria see Section V.A.Capital Advance funds must be used to finance construction, reconstruction, moderate or substantial rehabilitation, or acquisition of a structure with or without rehabilitation. Capital Advance funds bear no interest and repayment is not required if housing remains available for occupancy by Very-Low-Income Disabled Persons for at least 40 years. Applicants will include the requested Capital Advance funds in the SF424 and in the Development Budget (Section III.F.2.). The amount of the Capital Advance funds requested may not exceed the Total Development Cost as published by HUD (see 2022 UNIT TOTAL DEVELOPMENT COST (TDC) LIMITS) . The Total Development Cost limit is determined by identifying the appropriate building type (e.g., elevator) and unit size(s) in the development proposal. Project Rental Assistance Contracts (PRACs) are used to cover the difference between the tenants&apos; contributions toward rent and the HUD approved cost to operate the project. HUD encourages applicants to use Capital Advance funds in combination with other non-Section 811 funding but, Capital Advance funds may only be used in connection with units that will be assisted under the PRAC. PRAC units may be developed or placed within a property that also includes non-PRAC residential units (whether restricted as affordable or rented at market rates) and non-residential units (such as first floor commercial space).Partnerships. Sponsors/Owners are encouraged to establish formal partnerships with health and human service agencies or other organizations with a demonstrated capacity to coordinate voluntary services and support to enable individuals to live independently in the community. These partner organizations should assist the Owners by providing referrals of potential tenants, assisting with a timely transition to a unit, and providing the opportunity to access supportive services and support. Demonstrated capacity may refer to previous experience as well as a well-developed plan to provide referrals, services, and support. At a minimum, a well-developed supportive services plan:Aligns with the applicant&#8217;s local/State government&#8217;s approach to expanding community living opportunities for persons with disabilities.Documents an implementation and sustainment strategy for providing outreach and referrals, transition services, tenancy support, and other services and support as needed.Discusses the applicant&#8217;s approach for development and capacity building within the partnership.In addition to receiving referrals from partner organizations, the Owners must allow non-elderly persons with disabilities to apply for housing directly without going through a partner agency. There is no limit to the number of agencies an Owner may partner with for referrals and supportive services.In addition to local service providers, HUD encourages applicants to partner with one or more of the following State service agencies that offer tenant support:State Medicaid AgencyState Developmental Disability Services AgencyState Mental Health AuthorityCenters for Independent LivingSuch partnerships cannot result in eligibility requirements which may violate non-discrimination requirements under any applicable Federal civil rights statutes and requirements, including Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (Section 504), titles II or III of the Americans with Disabilities (ADA), and the Fair Housing Act and their implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 8; 28 CFR parts 35 and 36; 24 CFR part 100. In addition, compliance with HUD&#8217;s Equal Access Rule requires that eligibility determinations are made regardless of actual or perceived sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status."
85673,HUD,Department of Housing and Urban Development,HO,"The Resident Opportunity and Self Sufficiency Service Coordinator (ROSS-SC) program is designed to assist residents of Public and Indian Housing make progress towards economic and housing self-sufficiency by removing the educational, professional and health barriers they face. Self-sufficiency is defined as an individual&#8217;s ability to support their household by maintaining financial, housing, and personal/family stability. To achieve self-sufficiency, an individual moves along a continuum towards economic independence and stability; such movement is facilitated by the achievement of individual educational, professional, and health-related goals. To help residents make progress towards self-sufficiency, HUD provides ROSS-SC grant funding to eligible applicants to hire a Service Coordinator who assesses the needs of Public and Indian housing residents and links them to local training and supportive services that will enable participants to move along the self-sufficiency continuum. In the case of elderly/residents with disabilities, the Service Coordinator also links them to congregate and other supportive services which enable them to age/remain in place in addition to providing other desired training and supportive services which are made available to other residents.&#8239; In addition, with the ROSS-SC grant, HUD provides funding for grantees to provide direct services to further support the work of the ROSS-SC and ultimately, the goals of the ROSS program."
85906,HUD,Department of Housing and Urban Development,HO,"The purpose of this assistance is to continue investing in the creation and maintenance of a professional and effective housing counseling industry that is able to meaningfully assist consumers by providing them with the information they need to make informed housing choices and maximizes the impact of Federal funding appropriated for HUD&#8217;s Housing Counseling Program.Statutory requirements enacted as part of the Dodd&#8211;Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) require that individual housing counselors participating in HUD&#8217;s Housing Counseling Program shall demonstrate, by written examination, that they are competent in providing counseling in each of the core topics provided at section 106(e)(2)(12 U.S.C. 1701x(e)(2). HUD published the Final Rule implementing Housing Counseling Certification requirements on December 14, 2016 at 81 FR 90632. A revision of the certification timeline was later published in a Final Rule on December 4, 2020 at 85 FR 78230. The 2016 rule implements statutory requirements that housing counseling required under or provided in connection with all HUD programs must be provided by HUD a HUD-certified counselor employed by a HUD approved or Participating Agency . HUD requires six (6) Core Topics in which housing counselors need to be competent. These are: Financial Management; Property Maintenance; Homeownership and Tenancy; Fair Housing and other Civil Rights Laws and Requirements; Housing Affordability; Avoidance of, and responses to, rental and mortgage delinquency and avoidance of eviction and mortgage default.HUD also acknowledges the need for more housing counselors trained in Rental Housing and Mortgage Delinquency/Default counseling. In that regard, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) enacted on March 27, 2020, as well as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Federal Housing Administration (FHA) , provided various moratoriums on foreclosure and eviction filings to provide urgent economic relief to households impacted by COVID-19. The prospect of these moratoria expiring has amplified the need for more trained counselors. HUD also recognizes the important role housing counselors can provide in helping to mitigate delinquencies and defaults leading to s foreclosures and evictions and how that mitigation can help decrease losses to the FHA Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund. This assistance will expand the number of agencies and counselors who can provide Rental Housing and Mortgage Delinquency/Default counseling.Current HUD priorities also center on Disiaster Preparation and Recovery. Housing counseling agencies (HCA&apos;s) are in a unique position to help their communities prepare for and recover from a disaster. They can help their clients prepare for disasters by integrating preparedness into their counseling and education activities. Post-disaster, they can use their knowledge of local resources and programs to help clients navigate the complexities of disaster recovery resources and programs. This NOFO supports courses that provide training in the areas of disaster preparation and recovery. HUD recognizes that counselors may specialize in specific housing counseling topics, and that counselors will need more than general housing counseling training in order to provide high quality services that include general and specialized housing counseling topics.This NOFO provides notice of a grant program that supports the provision of both basic housing counseling training and specialized topics of training including training in the core topics for housing counselor certification, rental housing counseling, mortgage delinquency/default counseling, and disaster preparation and recovery to help meet these perceived needs. This financial support will assist housing counseling agencies to increase the use of partnerships with local and state-wide organizations to provide additional place-based training on state and local issues. In addition, this support should result in an increased number of training scholarships."

(NAHASDA). Under the program, eligible Indian tribes and tribally designated housing entities (TDHEs) receive grants to carry out a range of affordable housing activities. Grant funds may be used to develop, maintain, and operate affordable housing in safe and healthy environments on Indian reservations and in other Indian areas and carry out other affordable housing activities. Grant funds must be used to primarily benefit low-income Indian families.In the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2023 (Public Law 117-328) (Appropriations Act), Congress provided a total of $150,000,000 for competitive grants to eligible IHBG recipients authorized under NAHASDA in addition to formula-based funding. This NOFO describes the criteria that HUD will use to award IHBG Competitive grants, and outlines program requirements. In January 2017, HUD released a study entitled, &#8220;Housing Needs of American Indians and Alaska Natives in Tribal Areas: A Report from the Assessment of American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian Housing Needs.&#8221; Among the findings, the study found that conditions for tribal households are substantially worse than other U.S. households, with overcrowding in tribal areas being especially severe. The study noted that in the 2013-2015 period alone, 68,000 new units would have been necessary to help eliminate overcrowding and replace physically deteriorating units. Additional information is available at: https://www.huduser.gov/portal/pdredge/pdr-edge-research-022117.html.The Department recognizes that this additional IHBG funding provides an opportunity to fund strong and viable affordable housing projects in Indian Country.

88029,HUD,Department of Housing and Urban Development,HO,"More than 22 million Americans currently live in manufactured housing.[1] Manufactured housing units account for approximately seven percent of occupied housing stock nationwide and fifteen percent in rural areas.[2] Manufactured housing is also the largest source of unsubsidized affordable housing in the country, making it a crucial piece of the nation&#8217;s affordable housing stock.[3] The median household income of manufactured housing unit owners is about half the median household income of site-built homeowners [4].Manufactured housing can be permanently affixed to the lot underneath or be affixed to a support and anchoring system that allows the home to be relocated more easily. Manufactured housing is subject to HUD certification requirements pursuant to the regulations set forth in 24 CFR part 3282 (Manufactured Home Procedural and Enforcement Regulation) and the Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards set forth in 24 CFR 3280 (see the definition of manufactured housing in 24 CFR 3280.2).There are many significant challenges that may impact housing stability for those that live in manufactured homes. Despite perceptions of manufactured housing as &#8220;mobile,&#8221; manufactured housing can be very expensive and complicated to move, and more than 90% of manufactured homes do not move after the initial installation.[5] This can present a significant challenge for owners of manufactured homes who do not own the lot underneath their unit (referred to as &#8220;homesite renters&#8221; for the purposes of this NOFO). For some manufactured homeowners that rent a lot in a manufactured housing community (MHC), there is the potential for landowners or investors to increase lot rents, forcing homesite renters to make a difficult decision: pay to move their home, pay the increased rent, or leave their valuable asset.Due to state titling laws, many prospective homeowners looking to purchase a manufactured home may have no option but to finance their home with personal property or &#8220;chattel&#8221; loans, which often have higher interest rates than typical real property mortgages &#8211; even in situations where they may own the lot their home sits on. Many older manufactured homes require repairs or enhancements to make them livable and suitable to their environment, or they are sited in hazard prone areas. Meanwhile, nearly a third of households living in manufactured housing are headed by an elderly individual, and manufactured housing households have a higher prevalence of a significant disability.[6] These vulnerable populations need access to infrastructure and amenities that are often unavailable for residents of manufactured housing. The infrastructure serving manufactured housing communities is often self-operated, not built to high standards and has become increasingly stressed by deferred maintenance and extreme climate and weather events.[7]HUD is issuing the Preservation and Reinvestment Initiative for Community Enhancement (PRICE) competition NOFO to preserve long-term housing affordability for residents of manufactured housing or an MHC, to redevelop MHCs, and to primarily benefit low- and moderate-income (LMI) residents. This NOFO is authorized by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 (Public Law 117-328, approved December 29, 2022). Congress appropriated $225 million for competitive grants to preserve and revitalize manufactured housing and eligible manufactured housing communities and directed HUD to undertake a competition under title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended (42 U.S.C. 5301 et seq.). Of the $225 million available, $200 million is reserved for the main PRICE competition, of which at least $10 million is intended for Indian tribes or Tribally Designated Housing Entities and Tribal organizations designated by such Indian tribes (hereinafter referred to as &#8220;Tribal Applicants&#8221;), and $25 million is reserved for a pilot program to assist in the redevelopment of manufactured communities as replacement housing that is affordable. The minimum grant request for the main PRICE competition is $5 million for all applicants, except Tribal Applicants. Tribal Applicants may request a minimum of $500,000 for the main competition. The minimum grant request for the PRICE pilot is $5 million.HUD has six goals for this competition:Fairly and effectively award the PRICE grant funding and related technical assistance.Increase housing supply and affordability for LMI persons nationwide, including in urban, suburban, rural, and tribal areas.Preserve and revitalize existing manufactured housing and manufactured housing communities.Increase resilience to extreme weather, natural hazards, and disaster events, support energy efficiency, and protect the health and safety of manufactured housing residents.Promote homeownership opportunities and advance resident-controlled sustainable communities through new and revitalized units of manufactured housing that will remain affordable.Support accessibility modifications, repairs, and replacement of deteriorating manufactured housing units &#8211; especially to increase accessibility and access for persons with disabilities, facilitate aging in place for older adults and increase access to affordable housing for low-income households.Successful proposals will:Demonstrate a compelling need for the preservation and revitalization of manufactured housing or MHCs;Evaluate how manufactured housing and MHCs contribute to the local affordable housing stock and what resources are needed to rehabilitate or replace existing units and MHCs;Prioritize equity and affirmatively further fair housing by demonstrating a commitment and ability to identify and remove barriers to: 1) expanding access to affordable housing in a manner that promotes desegregation, and 2) expanding access to affordable housing for protected class groups, for example, by addressing the lack of physically accessible manufactured homes in accordance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 8, or by addressing policies preventing the rehabilitation of manufactured housing communities, deteriorating infrastructure, and lack of resources to support owners and residents of manufactured housing units.Engage a broad and inclusive stakeholder group, including residents of MHCs;Utilize strategies to reduce the impacts of environmental hazards and extreme weather;Increase community resilience, especially when reconstruction, relocation, or mitigation are involved; and,Ensure long-term housing availability, accessibility, and affordability for LMI households.Proposals may include the preservation and revitalization of manufactured housing units or MHCs at one or multiple sites and may span multiple jurisdictions. HUD seeks to preserve and revitalize manufactured housing units or communities in both urban and rural areas, as well as on Tribal lands and in disaster-prone communities. Eligible revitalization activities are broad and may include infrastructure or housing (and other eligible activities). HUD is instituting a requirement that all manufactured housing units receiving PRICE assistance must be maintained as affordable for a minimum period. Pursuant to title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended (42 U.S.C. 5301 et seq.), proposals may include, but are not limited to, the following eligible uses:Development or improvement of infrastructure that supports new or existing MHCs and/or manufactured housing units, including roads, sidewalks, water, and wastewater infrastructure including well and septic systems, and utility hookups;Environmental improvements such as remediation of contaminants in land servicing MHCs;Repair, rehabilitation, or replacement of existing manufactured housing units (pre-1976 units, which were referred to as mobile homes, may only be replaced. PRICE funds may not be used for their repair or rehabilitation);Planning activities around MHCs, including functional or implementation plans for land use or zoning changes to be more permissive of manufactured housing units or communities;Resident and community services, including relocation assistance (which may include moving manufactured housing units) and eviction prevention;Resilience activities, which include the reconstruction, repair, or replacement of manufactured housing and MHCs, as well as that for infrastructure serving MHCs, to enhance their safety and stability in the face of natural hazards such as, but not limited to, wildfires, earthquakes, tornados, extreme heat, and flooding, and to mitigate known hazards and the rising threat that extreme weather events present to manufactured housing due to climate change, except that for pre-1976 mobile homes, funds made available under resilience activities may be used only for replacement; or,Assisting manufactured housing renters or homesite renters with land and site acquisition.A portion of funds are reserved for PRICE pilot awards that may be used for the following:Redevelopment of MHCs as affordable replacement housing. Note that for each unit of single-family manufactured housing (including pre-1976 mobile homes) replaced under the project, up to four dwelling units of such affordable housing must be provided; or,Relocation assistance, buy-outs, or down payment assistance for residents.Manufactured Housing BackgroundManufactured homes are safe, quality housing and an affordable alternative often indistinguishable from site-built homes. Built in factories, the per square foot cost of producing a manufactured home is generally less than half the cost of constructing comparable site-built, single-family detached homes.[8] The lower production costs pass through to consumers as the purchase price and monthly costs of manufactured homes are generally less than half that of site-built homes. These lower costs provide an avenue to affordable homeownership options for LMI residents. With a large and growing shortage of affordable and physically accessible housing in the United States, manufactured housing can provide more rental and ownership options for LMI persons.The benefits and affordability of manufactured housing also apply to homes built on Tribal lands. About seventeen percent of households on Tribal land live in manufactured housing.[9] With approximately 68,000 new units needed to eliminate housing overcrowding in Tribal areas alone, more manufactured housing could help alleviate an acute housing shortage for the American Indian/Alaska Native population and assist to replace severely physically inadequate units.On June 22, 2023, HUD issued a Dear Tribal Leader letter soliciting Tribal feedback on manufacturing housing needs in Indian Country. Additionally, manufactured housing was also discussed at HUD&#8217;s inaugural Tribal Intergovernmental Advisory Committee (TIAC) meeting in April 2023, and Tribal representatives provided HUD feedback and recommendations. HUD received over seventy-four comments from more than ten respondents during Tribal consultation. HUD thanks all the respondents that provided Tribal feedback. This NOFO was developed in accordance with HUD&#8217;s Tribal consultation policy and incorporates feedback from Tribal leaders.A manufactured home is built to HUD&#8217;s Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards (&#8220;HUD Code&#8221;, 24 CFR part 3280), which are federal standards for the design and construction of manufactured homes to assure quality, durability, safety, and affordability. HUD was authorized to establish this code by the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974. Since then, Congress and HUD have advanced the manufactured housing regulatory framework (including rounds of improvements to the HUD Code for manufactured housing beginning in 1976, and minimum installation standards promulgated in 2007 (24 CFR part 3285) and continual updates including the more recently published updates to The Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards, 3rd set Final Rule (effective July 12, 2021)).Manufactured Housing StatisticsSite built homes average $167.87 per square foot while manufactured homes average $85.00 per square foot.[10]About 40 percent of manufactured homeowners rent the lot where their home is located. They typically rent individual plots of land, known as lots or pads, in MHCs owned and managed by a for-profit operator. Less commonly, borrowers may place the unit on someone else&#8217;s land (such as that belonging to a family member) without making payment, rent the land from a non-profit or government entity, or own the land indirectly, such as participating in a resident-controlled cooperative.[11]Freddie Mac estimates that there are 1,065 resident owned communities, constituting 2.4% of the 45,600 MHCs estimated to be operating in the U.S.[12]The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that 112,882 manufactured housing units were shipped across the country in 2022 &#8211; a number that has grown consistently since the market collapse in 2009.[13]New manufactured homes can be built to replace both aging manufactured homes as well as site-built housing stock. More than half of the overall U.S. housing stock is more than 42 years old and a quarter is more than 62 years old.[14]Manufactured housing has the potential to be an even more significant source of unsubsidized affordable housing than it is today. The Biden-Harris Administration&#8217;s Housing Supply Action Plan promotes the development of more attractive or low-cost financing for manufactured homes to increase the U.S. affordable housing supply.[15][1] Urban Institute.

94695,CNCS,Corporation for National and Community Service,HO,"A. Purpose of AmeriCorps fundingAmeriCorps grants are awarded to eligible organizations proposing to engage AmeriCorps members in evidence-based or evidence-informed (e.g., based on proposed program&#146;s data or a similar program&#146;s data) interventions to strengthen communities. An AmeriCorps member is an individual who engages in community service through an approved national service position. Members may receive a living allowance and other benefits while serving. Upon successful completion of their service, members receive a Segal AmeriCorps Education Award from the National Service Trust. For two decades, the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) has invested in community solutions across the nation -- working hand in hand with local partners to improve lives, expand economic opportunity, and engage millions of Americans in solving problems in their communities. With its unique structure as a public-private partnership and its model of engaging citizens and requiring matching resources from outside parties, national service can benefit the recipients of service, those who serve, local communities, and our nation. Through all its programs, CNCS seeks to expand economic opportunity &#150; helping Americans acquire the skills, education, and training they need for productive employment. By helping more Americans graduate, pursue higher education, and find work, national service can provide immediate and long term benefits by expanding individual opportunity, building family stability, and creating more sustainable, resilient communities.Through AmeriCorps and its other programs, CNCS brings vital leadership, resources, and coordination to some of the most pressing challenges facing America: educating students for jobs of the 21st century; assisting individuals, families, and neighborhoods on the road to economic recovery; addressing the needs of military families and a new generation of veterans; helping communities rebuild after natural disasters; increasing energy efficiency and improving at-risk ecosystems; and providing information to improve the health and welfare of individuals in disadvantaged communities.B. Focus AreasIn order to carry out Congress&#146; intent and to maximize the impact of investment in national service, CNCS is targeting AmeriCorps funds to the following focus areas:Disaster ServicesGrant activities will increase the preparedness of individuals, improve individuals&#146; readiness to respond, help individuals recover from disasters, and help individuals mitigate disasters. Grantees also have the ability to respond to national disasters under CNCS cooperative agreements and FEMA mission assignments. Economic OpportunityGrants will provide support and/or facilitate access to services and resources that contribute to the improved economic well-being and security of economically disadvantaged people. Grant activities will help economically disadvantaged people to have improved access to services aimed at contributing to their enhanced financial literacy; transition into or remain in safe, healthy, affordable housing; and have improved employability leading to increased success in becoming employed. Education Grants will provide support and/or facilitate access to services and resources that contribute to improved educational outcomes for economically disadvantaged individuals, especially children. CNCS is particularly interested in program designs that support youth engagement and service-learning as strategies to achieve improved academic outcomes. Grant activities will improve school readiness for economically disadvantaged young children; educational and behavioral outcomes of students in low-achieving elementary, middle, and high schools; and the preparation for, and prospects of success, in post-secondary educational institutions for economically disadvantaged students. Environmental StewardshipGrants will provide support for direct services that contribute to increased energy and water efficiency, renewable energy use, or improving at-risk ecosystems. In addition, grants will support increased individual behavioral change leading to increased efficiency, renewable energy use, and ecosystem improvements particularly for economically disadvantaged households and communities. Grant activities will decrease energy and water consumption; improve at-risk ecosystems; increase behavioral changes that lead directly to decreased energy and water consumption or improved at-risk ecosystems; and increase green training opportunities that may lead to decreased energy and water consumption or improved at-risk ecosystems.In addition, the Administration is exploring ways to provide service, training, education, and employment opportunities for young Americans through protecting, restoring and enhancing public and tribal lands. CNCS is exploring potential programs along the lines of a &#147;21st century Civilian Service Corps&#148; that can facilitate conservation service work on public lands and encourage a new generation of natural resource managers and environmental scientists, particularly in low income and disadvantaged communities. Healthy FuturesGrants will provide support for health needs within communities including access to care, aging in place, and childhood obesity. Grant activities will improve access to primary and preventive health care for communities served by CNCS-supported programs; increase seniors&#146; ability to remain in their own homes with the same or improved quality of life for as long as possible; and increase physical activity and improve nutrition in youth with the purpose of reducing childhood obesity.Veterans and Military FamiliesGrants will positively impact the quality of life of veterans and improve military family strength. Grant activities will increase the number of veterans and military service members and their families served by CNCS-supported programs and increase the number of veterans and military family members engaged in service through CNCS-supported programs. To the greatest extent possible, proposed activities should be aligned with the Veteran and Military Family National Performance Measures. Governor and Mayor InitiativeCNCS will be continuing its pilot of the Governor and Mayor Initiative, which will be given priority consideration in Tier 1. CNCS will accept one application per state. The application must address a pressing challenge the Governor wishes to solve in her or his state. A Governor must apply with one Mayor in his or her state and a minimum of two nonprofits. In conjunction with the Mayor, the Governor will be responsible for identifying and selecting those nonprofits that are best able to achieve a demonstrated positive impact on the problem. The application should include letters of commitment from all relevant parties. If the Governor and Mayor have not yet selected partnering nonprofit entities, they should describe the process that the Governor and Mayor will use to select the nonprofit entities. The application, submitted to the State Commission, will respond to the application criteria and explain how several nonprofits working together, with the Governor&#146;s office serving as a convener, will effectively deploy AmeriCorps members for a collective impact. Only the Governor, Mayor, their designated government office (but not the state commission), or a public university may apply for grants under the Governor and Mayor initiative. Applications from other entities will be deemed non-compliant and will not be considered under this initiative.For example, a Governor and a Mayor in a state could conclude the most pressing challenge facing the state is its high school graduation rate. The Governor and/or Mayor would submit one application describing:How the partnership will be organized and AmeriCorps resources will be allocated between the partnering entities (State, locality, and nonprofit entities).The proposed theory of change and program model.How they will utilize an identified consortium of nonprofits that are well positioned to achieve outcomes identified in the theory of change.C. Additional Program ModelsCapacity BuildingGrants also will provide support for capacity building activities provided by national service participants. As a general rule, CNCS considers capacity building activities to be indirect services that enable CNCS-supported organizations to provide more, better, and sustained direct services in CNCS&#146; six focus areas. Capacity building activities cannot be solely intended to support the administration or operations of the organization. Examples of capacity building activities include recruiting and/or managing community volunteers; implementing effective volunteer management practices; completing community assessments that identify goals and recommendations; developing new systems and business processes (technology, performance management, training, etc.); or enhancing existing systems and business processes.Encore ProgramsCongress set a goal that 10 percent of AmeriCorps funding should support encore service programs that engage a significant number of participants age 55 or older. CNCS seeks to meet that 10 percent target in this competition and encourages encore programs to apply. Professional Corps Professional Corps programs recruit and place qualified members in positions as teachers, health care providers, police officers, engineers, or other professionals in communities with an inadequate number of such professionals. Applicants are eligible to apply for funding for a portion of the program costs. Professional Corps members&#146; salaries are paid entirely by the organizations with which the members serve, and are not included in the budget. In order to be considered for funding, applicants must demonstrate that there are an inadequate number of professionals in the community(ies) where the corps seeks to place members. These grants can either be fixed amount or cost reimbursement grants.D. National Performance MeasuresThe SAA emphasizes measuring the impact of service and focusing on a core set of issue areas. CNCS&#146; five-year Strategic Plan establishes an ambitious set of objectives that support the mission and goals to implement the Serve America Act. These strategic goals guided the development of 16 agency-wide Priority Performance Measures. National Performance Measures allow CNCS to demonstrate aggregated impact of all its national service programs, including AmeriCorps State and National. They are divided in two categories: Priority Measures and Complementary Program Measures. For more information, please refer to the National Performance Measure Instructions.E. 2014 AmeriCorps Funding Priorities In the FY 2014 AmeriCorps competition, CNCS seeks to prioritize the investment of national service resources in economic opportunity, education, veterans and military families, disaster services, and the Governor and Mayor Initiative. CNCS will continue to focus on national service programs that improve academic outcomes for children, youth, and young adults. This focus reflects the extensive experience and past success of national service programs in education, and aligns with the efforts of the Department of Education. In addition, CNCS seeks to increase its investment in programs that serve veterans and military families or engage veterans and military families in service. CNCS will also focus investment in programs that increase community resiliency through disaster preparation, response, recovery, and mitigation. CNCS will focus investment in programs that increase economic opportunities for communities and AmeriCorps members. Finally, CNCS will focus on summer programming for K-12 students, especially those programs that address the academic &#147;summer slide.&#148; Proposed activities will engage youth and young adults as summer members to help support summer reading, math, science, and environmental learning activities for youth in rural and urban areas most likely at risk of summer learning loss.CNCS will seek to build a diversified portfolio across the focus areas, and other considerations are outlined below in Section V. B. Applicants proposing programs that receive priority consideration are not guaranteed funding. Furthermore, programs must demonstrate significant program focus, design, and outcomes to receive priority consideration. CNCS will give priority consideration to applicants in the following Tiers, in descending order of preference:Tier 1: Programs that select:Complementary Program Measures in Economic Opportunity (Programs that select O12, O14, O15, O17 must also select an additional Priority or Complementary Program Measure from Tier 1, 2, or 3 that measures community impact), orPriority Measures in Veterans and Military Families, or Priority Measures in Disaster Services, orA Governor and Mayor InitiativeNOTE: CNCS&#146; expectation is that if Tier 1 is selected at least 30% of your MSYs are in the complementary program measures or priority measures above.

Education: Grants will provide support and/or facilitate access to services and resources that contribute to improved educational outcomes for economically disadvantaged people, especially children. CNCS is particularly interested in program designs that support youth engagement and service-learning as strategies to achieve high educational outcomes. Grant activities will improve: &#239;&#191;&#189; school readiness for economically disadvantaged young children, &#239;&#191;&#189; educational and behavioral outcomes of students in low-achieving elementary, middle, and high schools, and &#239;&#191;&#189; the preparation for and prospects of success in post-secondary education institutions for economically disadvantaged students. Environmental Stewardship: Grants will provide direct services that contribute to increased energy and water efficiency, renewable energy use, or improving at-risk ecosystems, and support increased citizen behavioral change leading to increased efficiency, renewable energy use, and ecosystem improvements particularly for economically disadvantaged households and economically disadvantaged communities. Grant activities will: &#239;&#191;&#189; decrease energy and water consumption, &#239;&#191;&#189; improve at-risk ecosystems, &#239;&#191;&#189; increase behavioral changes that lead directly to decreased energy and water consumption or improve at-risk ecosystems, and &#239;&#191;&#189; increase green training opportunities that may lead to decreased energy and water consumption or improve at-risk ecosystems. Healthy Futures: Grants will meet health needs within communities including access to care, aging in place, and addressing childhood obesity. Grant activities will: &#239;&#191;&#189; increase seniors&#239;&#191;&#189; ability to remain in their own homes with the same or improved quality of life for as long as possible, &#239;&#191;&#189; increase physical activity and improve nutrition in youth with the purpose of reducing childhood obesity, and &#239;&#191;&#189; improve access to primary and preventive health care for communities served by CNCS-supported programs (access to health care).

As a general rule, CNCS considers capacity building activities to be indirect services that enable CNCS-supported organizations to provide more, better and sustained direct services. Capacity building activities cannot be solely intended to support the administration or operations of the organization. Examples of capacity building activities include: &#239;&#191;&#189; Recruiting and/or managing community volunteers &#239;&#191;&#189; Implementing effective volunteer management practices &#239;&#191;&#189; Completing community assessments that identify goals and recommendations &#239;&#191;&#189; Developing new systems and business processes (technology, performance management, training, etc.) or enhancing existing systems and business processes Encore Programs Congress set a goal that 10 percent of AmeriCorps funding should support encore service programs.

DIV funds innovation that targets USAID&#146;s Mission Statement . Innovations could include new technologies, new ways of delivering and/or financing goods and services, more cost-effective adaptations of existing solutions, new ways to increase uptake of existing proven solutions, etc. The more funding requested, the more confidence DIV will need in the evidence-base underpinning the innovation. This includes gathering appropriate evidence of impact and/or commercial viability at each stage and for each type of scale path. Solutions must have a potential pathway to scale commercially or through incorporation into the practices of developing country governments, donors, philanthropists, or through a combination of commercial and public or philanthropic support. Innovations should ultimately reach sustainability without continuing DIV support. DIV employs a staged funding model, with size of investment commensurate with evidence of potential for success. DIV recognizes that organizations supported will need flexibility to iterate and adapt innovations and DIV strives to provide this flexibility. To attract the best innovations, applications on all development topics and sectors are welcome. DIV welcomes applications from U.S. and non-US organizations, individuals, non-profit, and for-profit entities, provided their work is in a country where USAID operates. There are several types of projects that are not a good fit for DIV&#146;s objectives.
