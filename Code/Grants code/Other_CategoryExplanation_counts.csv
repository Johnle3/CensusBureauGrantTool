"EDA&#8217;s mission is to lead the Federal economic development agenda by promoting innovation and competitiveness, preparing American regions for economic growth and success in the worldwide economy. EDA fulfills this mission through strategic investments and partnerships that create the conditions for economic growth and improved quality of life by expanding the capacity of individuals, firms, and communities to maximize the use of their talents and skills to support innovation, lower transaction costs, and responsibly produce and trade valuable goods and services. The achievement of economic development potential results in regional economic ecosystems that foster globally competitive regions throughout the United States. The economic ecosystem is a multifaceted concept that links together a highly networked regional talent pool; innovation infrastructure (including both tangible and non-tangible types); research and science support systems; and a culture of collaboration sustained by institutions focused on advancing mutual gain for the public and the private sector.   The purpose of EDA&#8217;s University Center Economic Development Program (also referred to in this announcement as the University Center program) is to enable institutions of higher education and consortia of institutions of higher education to establish and operate University Centers specifically focused on using university assets to build regional economic ecosystems that support innovation and high-growth entrepreneurship. University Centers collaborate with other EDA partners by providing expertise and technical assistance to develop, implement and support regional strategies which result in job creation, high-skilled regional talent pools, and business expansion in a region&#8217;s innovation clusters . Expertise and technical assistance may address, for example, applied research centers, technology commercialization, feasibility studies, market research, economic impact analyses training, and other technical assistance to help communities foster vibrant economic ecosystems.  Since FY 2004, EDA has administered the University Center program as a competitive multi year program. As presented in the table below, EDA holds University Center program competitions in two of its six regional offices each of the following fiscal years. In FY 2017, EDA is holding the competition in its Atlanta and Seattle Regional Offices. ",2

"TOPIC 1: Strengthening the Role of Women and Marginalized Communities through Civic Education and Entrepreneurship     Problem Statement: In 2020, Uzbekistan was selected as a member of the UN Human Rights Council and has since signed international agreements in a number of areas including the rights of women, children and people with disabilities. To support the Government of Uzbekistan&#8217;s efforts in strengthening civil society, the U.S. Embassy seeks to support projects that support women and other marginalized communities, including people with disabilities, across all segments of society.   Throughout Uzbekistan, women and people with disabilities face discrimination and inequality in social, economic, and political life. Empowerment of these communities requires not only legal protections, but also economic independence. Entrepreneurship can be an important way for women and vulnerable populations to enter the workforce and bring much needed money into rural communities. Key obstacles to entrepreneurship include: a lack of familiarity with entrepreneurship as a valid career choice, and the need for support to develop business plans and navigate the legal hurdles required when establishing a business.   The U.S. Embassy is seeking to fund organizations that encourage and support entrepreneurship opportunities for women and marginalized communities, including people with disabilities, as well as programs that focus on women&#8217;s empowerment and legal support.     TOPIC 2: Strengthening Independent Media    Problem Statement: A strong and independent media is a key tenant of democracy and can be strengthened in Uzbekistan. The majority of Uzbek media is state controlled. Journalists lack proper training to report competently on political and economic issues, and investigative reporting is very limited. President Mirziyoyev has emphasized the important role of a free and independent media in aiding the country&#8217;s reform process. While Uzbekistan rose from 160th place out of 180 countries to 156th in the 2020 World Press Freedom ranking list, the country moved back to 157th in the 2021 ranking. To help keep Uzbekistan from slipping backward further and to support existing efforts to bolster independent media and increase capacity for journalists, this funding opportunity seeks to expand media programming by addressing lack of journalistic capacity and insufficient attention on political, economic, and other societal issues in Uzbek society.",1

"The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, Title XIII of Division A and Title IV of Division B of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), Pub. L. No. 111-5, set forth a plan for advancing a nationwide health information technology infrastructure to facilitate the electronic use and exchange of information and to improve the quality and efficiency of health care, among other objectives. Central to this vision of nationwide electronic health information exchange is the use of electronic health records (EHRs). The HITECH Act authorizes the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) to administer incentive payments to eligible professionals (EPs), eligible hospitals, and critical access hospitals (CAHs) for adopting, implementing, or upgrading certified EHR technology (Medicaid incentives only), and for demonstrating &#147;meaningful use&#148; of certified EHR technology (Medicare and Medicaid incentives).&#148; Since 2008, ONC has partnered with the AHA through grants administered through NIH to track the use of health IT and related insights in U.S. hospitals. ONC now has its own grant management capability, and more importantly, is explicitly tasked through the HITECH Act with overseeing many federal efforts relating to health IT. As a result, continuing to track the adoption of electronic health records and related attitudes and insights in U.S. hospitals is critical to the responsibilities of ONC and evaluating the impact of Medicare and Medicaid incentives and related ONC programs.",1

This recipient and project meet this criteria due to the fact that the use of constructed wetlands to mitigate effluent from an aquaculture facility is an innovative approach to waste water treatment.

Professors at Montana State University have unique expertise in not only designing constructed wetlands to operate in a cold weather climate but also implementing these systems into full scale rather than pilot scale operations.  The unique expertise that is housed at Montana State University, Center for Biofilm Engineering coupled with the fact that it is in close proximity to both Ennis National Fish hatchery and the Bozeman Fish Technology Center makes it uniquely qualified to be involved in the implementation of a constructed wetland at Ennis National Fish Hatchery.",1

"The CAPRISA 004 clinical trial of 1% tenofovir gel, conducted by South African investigators and jointly supported by USAID and the Government of South Africa, was the first demonstration that a vaginal microbicide could significantly reduce the risk of HIV infection.

Simultaneously, other promising microbicide leads are moving forward in the product development pipeline as well.

"The mission of the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) is to improve lives, strengthen communities, and foster civic participation through service and volunteering. For more than fifteen years, CNCS&#239;&#191;&#189;through its Senior Corps, AmeriCorps, and Learn and Serve America programs&#239;&#191;&#189;has helped to engage millions of citizens in meeting community and national challenges through service and volunteer action.     On April 21, 2009, President Obama signed the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act, the most sweeping expansion of national service in a generation. This landmark law not only expands service opportunities, but also focuses national service on key outcomes; builds the capacity of individuals, nonprofits, and communities to succeed; and encourages innovative approaches to solving problems.    In alignment with the Serve America Act, this AmeriCorps State and National (AmeriCorps) Notice of Federal Funding Opportunity will focus AmeriCorps grantmaking in the Veterans and Military Families Focus Area.    In order to carry out Congress&#239;&#191;&#189; intent and to maximize the impact of the investment in national service, CNCS is seeking to fund programs that can demonstrate community impact and solve community problems through an evidence-based approach (e.g. performance data, research, theory of change).     In the AmeriCorps competition this year, CNCS especially seeks to prioritize investment in three areas of its work. CNCS will continue to focus on national service programs that improve academic outcomes for children, youth, and young adults. This focus reflects the extensive experience and past success of national service programs in education, and aligns with the efforts of the Department of Education. In addition, CNCS seeks to increase its investment in programs that serve veterans and military families or engage veterans in service.

"The overall objective of this funding opportunity is to support impactful, large marine debris removal projects that will improve the resilience of the coastal and marine environment and implement strategies to prevent the re-accumulation of marine debris. &#8220;Impactful&#8221; projects are considered to be those that will have long-lasting, transformational benefits to marine and coastal NOAA trust resources, coastal communities, and/or local economies. This funding opportunity will openly compete funding made available through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (PL 117-58), and will focus support for impactful marine debris removal efforts throughout the coastal United States (including coastal riverine systems), Great Lakes, territories, and freely associated states, including Tribal and underserved communities.             The NOAA Marine Debris Program (MDP), a division of the Office of Response and Restoration, leads national efforts to address marine debris. The mission of the NOAA MDP is to investigate and prevent the adverse impacts of marine debris. This mission is achieved through research, prevention, and removal activities that aim to conserve and protect our nation&#8217;s marine environment and coastal economy, as well as ensure navigation safety.            Marine debris is defined as &quot;any persistent solid material that is manufactured or processed and directly or indirectly, intentionally or unintentionally, disposed of or abandoned into the marine environment or the Great Lakes&quot; (15 C.F.R. &#167; 909.1). For the purposes of this funding opportunity, &#8220;large debris&#8221; is defined as abandoned and derelict vessels (ADVs), derelict fishing gear (DFG), and other debris that is unable to be easily collected by hand.            In alignment with the Executive Order 13985 on Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities through the Federal Government, the NOAA MDP encourages applicants and awardees to support the principles of diversity, equity, inclusion, justice, and accessibility when writing their proposals and performing their work. Ensuring these principles means paying particular attention to the most vulnerable or underserved communities, which are often low-income, those already overburdened by pollution, those who lack economic or social opportunity, and people facing disenfranchisement.",1

"-Cybersecurity: Cybersecurity is crucial in today&apos;s digital world due to the increasing reliance on technology, the proliferation of digital threats from malign actors, and the potential for significant financial, reputational, and operational damage resulting from cyberattacks.  It is a constantly evolving field that requires ongoing efforts to stay ahead of new and emerging threats.    -Workforce Development:  The shortage of 3.5 million cybersecurity professionals worldwide has a significant impact in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where the cybersecurity environment is underdeveloped, and talent pipelines need to be strengthened.  Addressing this is essential both for the country&#8217;s security and to develop a steady pipeline of qualified candidates to meet employers&#8217; needs.  This is a key component of economic growth and development in BiH.  -Social Inclusion:  People with disabilities in BiH face numerous barriers to educational opportunities, workforce participation, and social inclusion. By providing people with disabilities an opportunity for access to training and certification, we can help integrate them into the 21st century workforce while supporting the broader inclusion of a traditionally marginalized population into society.  -Reconciliation:  Participation in the program will foster a network of cybersecurity professionals in many parts of the country, supporting reconciliation while improving BiH&#8217;s cyber resiliency.",1

ISN/CTR administers the Biosecurity Engagement Program (BEP) program as part of the Global Threat Reduction (GTR) portfolio.  BEP&#8217;s mission involves institutionalizing biorisk management best practices, securing life science institutions and dangerous pathogens, decreasing the risk that scientists with dual-use expertise will misuse pathogens, and promoting adoption of and compliance with comprehensive international frameworks that advance U.S. biological nonproliferation objectives, including United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1540, the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), the World Health Organization&#8217;s International Health Regulations, and the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) / International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards.

The first pillar increases biosecurity and biosafety through technical consultations, risk assessments, and training courses that develop expertise to create a sustainable culture of laboratory biorisk management.  As a part of BEP&#8217;s biosecurity efforts, the program also sponsors efforts to train foreign law enforcement and security forces on approaches for detecting, investigating, and disrupting bioterrorism plots.  The second pillar of engagement focuses on infectious disease detection and control as well as strengthening the capacity for public and veterinary health systems to detect, report, and control disease outbreaks.  The third pillar of engagement focuses on scientific engagement to enhance global health security and foster safe, secure, and sustainable bioscience capacity through joint scientific collaborations designed to help prevent, detect, and respond to biological threats.

CNCS&#151;through its AmeriCorps and Senior Corps programs &#151;has helped to engage millions of citizens in meeting community and national challenges through service and volunteer action.     The FY15 Operation AmeriCorps competition has two funding priorities. Applicants may choose to apply to either of the priorities. The first priority focuses on specific post-secondary outcomes for students. The second priority allows localities to identify their most pressing challenge. In each case, the most important element is choosing a project that will be a game-changer for the local community and ensuring that there are clear outcomes to measure success.    Priority one applications will propose a transformational project that uses a national service to ensure that every high school senior has a career or educational opportunity upon graduation. Using AmeriCorps as the catalyst to engage the whole community, the goal is for every graduating high school senior to participate in one of the following five options after graduation: further education; military service; national service in AmeriCorps or the Peace Corps; employment; or a paid internship, a registered apprenticeship, or job training program.    Under priority one, applicants must design an AmeriCorps intervention to ensure that each high school senior in their community has one of these options. Priority one applications will receive higher preference for funding than priority two applications.     Priority two applicants may propose transformational projects that address any of CNCS&#146;s six focus areas: disaster services, economic opportunity, education, environmental stewardship, healthy futures, or veterans and military families. Examples include projects that use national service resources to ensure every third grader is reading on grade level, greatly increase energy efficiency, or end veterans&#146; homelessness. Applicants will be responsible for determining the specific design and outcomes for any priority two projects they propose.  ",1

"SUMMARY  The Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor (DRL) and the Secretary&#146;s Office of Global Women&#146;s Issues (S/GWI) announce a Request for Proposals (RFP) from organizations interested in submitting proposals to support and address the specific challenges and needs of women in Iraq.  The Department of State recognizes that women&#146;s empowerment and equal and active civic involvement are key components of a thriving society.  Secretary Clinton stated, &#147;Women and girls are one of the world&#146;s greatest untapped resources.  Investing in the potential of women to lift and lead their societies is one of the best investments we can make. [The] studies that have shown when a woman receives even just one year of schooling, her children are less likely to die in infancy or suffer from illness or hunger, and more likely to go to school themselves.&#148;  The Department is therefore deeply committed to ensuring that women&#146;s rights are fully integrated into U.S. foreign policy.    To address the concerns and needs of women in Iraq, DRL and S/GWI announce an open competition for assistance from the U.S. Department of State&#146;s Fiscal Year 2010 Economic Support Funds (ESF) from organizations interested in submitting proposals for projects that focus on immediate support to promote women&#146;s human rights and the inclusion of women in the social, political, and economic fabric of Iraqi society.  Organizations should have a demonstrated capacity to work in Iraq on issues related to women and proposals should provide measurable outcomes and clearly explain how their proposed projects would address needs not covered by existing or other planned programs in Iraq.  Applicants are also highly encouraged to identify local partners and NGOs in Iraq for segments of their proposed work plan.  This request for proposals does not guarantee funding and is subject to approval by the Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women&#146;s Issues; the Assistant Secretary for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor; and the Office of Acquisitions Management.

"Clinical trials of vaginal microbicide have been tested recently in South Africa to determine efficacy of reduction of HIV infection.      Microbicide research, development, and introduction activities which could potentially be supported through this APS mechanism are expected to contribute substantially to the Principles of the Global Health Initiative (GHI), particularly in promoting research and innovation; implementing a woman- and girl-centered approach; strengthening and leveraging inputs from multilateral organizations, global health partnerships, and the private sector; and encouraging country ownership and leadership.  Potential activities could also contribute significantly to strengthening the health system building blocks related to commodities and procurement, service delivery, and leadership and governance.  It is expected that gender analyses and other gender considerations will continue to inform the design and implementation of activities implemented as part of the Agency&#146;s microbicide program.  All awards will also be subject to USAID environmental requirements, including completion of an initial environmental examination.    This APS is intended to support the creative research and other innovative activities that are now essential to advance potential microbicides toward regulatory approval and then to successfully introduce them into delivery programs.

In the AmeriCorps State and National competition this year, the Corporation especially seeks to focus investment on national service programs that improve academic outcomes for children, youth and young adults. This focus reflects the extensive experience and past success of national service programs in education, and aligns with the reform efforts of the Department of Education. In addition, the Corporation seeks to increase its investment in programs that serve veterans and military families, or that engage veterans in service. ",1

"Agriculture-based renewable energy offers many rural areas a means of strengthening their economy while helping meet the nation&#146;s energy demands. Many rural communities have struggled for decades with the loss of jobs and income from restructuring in the agricultural and manufacturing sectors. Rural community colleges and advanced technological centers promote access to educational programs and aid in workforce development that is vital to creating rural economies that are competitive in the global marketplace.    With this RFA, NIFA announces the availability of funding and requests applications for the New Era Rural Technology Competitive Grants Program (RTP) for fiscal year (FY) 2010. RTP grants are for technology development, applied research, and/or training to develop an agriculture-based renewable energy workforce to serve rural communities.  Awards will stimulate and enable community colleges and advanced technological centers located in rural areas (Note: see definitions of these terms in Part VIII, E. to ensure eligibility) to provide technology development, applied research, and/or training necessary to produce graduates capable of strengthening the Nation&#146;s technical, scientific and professional workforce in the fields of bioenergy, pulp and paper manufacturing, and agriculture-based renewable energy resources.     The amount available for support of this program in FY 2010 is $850,000.

"The Economic Development Administration&#146;s (EDA&#146;s) mission is to lead the federal economic development agenda by promoting innovation and competitiveness, preparing American regions for growth and success in the worldwide economy. In implementing this mission, EDA announces the agency&#146;s procedures for providing assistance under the Community Trade Adjustment Assistance (Community TAA) Program under the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. &#167; 2341 et seq.) (Trade Act).     The Community TAA Program is designed to provide communities with comprehensive and flexible solutions to a wide variety of trade impacts. There currently are a number of Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) programs authorized under the Trade Act that target assistance to specific groups within and members of a community, such as workers and firms. However, the negative impacts of trade are not just felt by discrete groups; they reverberate throughout an entire community. The closure or downsizing of a key industry, company, or plant creates severe economic challenges for an entire community impacted by trade. The Community TAA Program supplements and builds upon the other TAA programs by providing comprehensive assistance to communities affected by Cognizable Certifications made under one or more of three TAA programs (TAA for Workers, Firms, or Farmers) to address these challenges. The overall goal of the Community TAA Program is to help communities respond holistically and proactively to trade impacts and become more competitive in the global economy. The Community TAA program will help eligible communities devise long-term Strategic Plans and carry out implementation activities to address economic development challenges in regions affected by trade impacts.",1
